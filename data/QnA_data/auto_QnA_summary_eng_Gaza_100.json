In Gaza, climate experts have warned that the summer heat could make the Strip's existing problems even worse.\n\nAccording to the Climate Shift Index, a tool that quantifies the contribution of climate change to daily temperatures, the eastern Mediterranean region, including Gaza, is experiencing significant temperature anomalies this spring.\n\nThe coastal enclave has been gripped by extreme heat already this year, with temperatures climbing over 100 degrees Fahrenheit over several days in late April.\n\nThe extreme heat is part of a broader pattern, as the Middle East is heating up faster than most other regions on the planet. Scientists concluded in 2022 that the region's temperatures are rising at twice the global average rate.\n\nThe onset of punishing summer heat in the densely populated Gaza Strip, where hundreds of thousands are living in tents, has made daily life even more arduous. The humanitarian situation has worsened since the beginning of the war in October, with more than a million people displaced, according to U.N. figures.\n\nThe ongoing conflict has claimed thousands of lives and left many more injured since the Hamas attacks of Oct. 7 killed 1,200 Israelis, triggering the war. The Health Ministry in Gaza reports that more than 34,000 people have died since the conflict began, though the group does not make clear how many of those were combatants and the reliability of its casualty figures has been questioned.",

        "body": "The G7 leaders stressed their determination to meet global challenges \"at a crucial moment in history\".\n\nThe gathering in a luxury resort in Italy's southern Puglia region also discussed other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, the war in Gaza, climate change, Iran, the situation in the Red Sea, gender equality and China's industrial policy and economic security.\n\n\"We are working together and with others to address the pressing challenges of our time,\" the G7 leaders said in a final statement, noting their solidarity with Ukraine, support for a deal that would lead to an immediate ceasefire and release of hostages in Gaza, investment in sustainable infrastructure in Africa and commitments to address climate change and migration.\n\nDivisions did emerge during the summit, however, notably over the lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final declaration.\n\nAsked if the G7 gathering has lived up to expectations, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"The aim of the G7 is to create convergence and be able to remove misunderstandings. It's not a place where you decide emergency measures or regulate things.\" He added that there were \"true convergences on Ukraine and Mideast\".\n\n\"It was a useful G7, with useful results,\" Mr Macron said. \"The coming weeks will create the conditions for political opportunities in particular around the two conflicts.\"\n\nMigration was the first topic of discussions on Friday, with the leaders mulling ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.\n\nThe issue is of particular interest to summit host Italy, which lies on one of the major routes into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her hardline stance on migration, has been eager to increase investment and funding for African nations as a means of reducing migratory pressure on Europe.\n\nThe leaders \"launched the G7 Coalition to prevent and counter the smuggling of migrants\", the summit's final declaration said, noting the seven nations would \"focus on the root causes of irregular migration, efforts to enhance border management and curb transnational organised crime, and safe and regular pathways for migration\".\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he and Ms Meloni - whom he described as \"fantastic\" - saw \"eye to eye\" on migration.\n\n\"We can't have criminal gangs decide who comes to our countries,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\nMs Meloni has a controversial five-year deal with neighbouring Albania for the Balkan country to host thousands of asylum seekers while Italy processes their claims. She has also spearheaded the \"Mattei Plan\" for Africa, a continent-wide strategy to increase economic opportunities at home and so discourage migration.\n\nFor its part, Britain has a deal to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, although no flights have yet taken off. Human rights organisations have criticised the agreement as unethical and unworkable.\n\nThe United States has also been struggling with a growing number of migrants. President Joe Biden introduced new policies to curb migration after a Bill he tried to get through Congress failed to pass. However, the future of the new policies is unclear after immigrant rights advocates challenged them with lawsuits.\n\nApart from the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, the Italian hosts also invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Ms Meloni's migration and development initiatives.\n\nBut rights groups decried what they said was a lack of ambition in support for developing countries.\n\nThe ONE Campaign, which advocates for investment in Africa, said it had found the G7 and EU institutions' share of aid going to Africa was at its lowest point since 1973.\n\n\"Without any concrete action, the G7 in Italy amounts to no more than pointless platitudes,\" said David McNair, executive director at The ONE Campaign.\n\nAlthough the summit's final statement \"reflects promises of increased partnership between the G7 and Africa, there are very few specifics on what new financing, if any, will be available\".\n\nPope Francis also became the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, delivering a speech on artificial intelligence. Other invitees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe summit opened on Thursday with a strong show of support for Kyiv: an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion-dollar (£39.5 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denounced the freezing of Russian assets as \"theft\" and vowed it \"will not go unpunished\".\n\nMr Biden also signed a bilateral security agreement with Mr Zelensky, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv.\n\nBut some cracks appeared among the G7 leaders, notably Mr Macron deploring a lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final document.\n\nThe statement after last year's summit in Hiroshima, Japan, expressed a commitment to provide access to safe and legal abortion to women and girls, and pledged to defend gender equality and the rights of members of the LGBT+ community.\n\nThe word \"abortion\" was absent from this year's final communique, although it included a reference to promoting sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\n\"It was not possible to reach agreement on these things in the room,\" a senior EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the private discussions.\n\nAsked on Thursday about reports that abortion would not be included in the final text, Mr Macron said it was something he regretted.\n\nFrance \"has included women's right to abortion, the freedom of decision on one's own body, into its constitution\", he said, adding that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men\".\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" Mr Macron said.\n\nMs Meloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has denied she is rolling back rights to abortions, which have been legal in Italy since 1978. But the centre-left opposition has warned that her initiatives are chipping away at those rights, including by giving pro-life groups access to women considering abortions.",

U.S. President Joe Biden signed a bilateral security agreement with Ukraine. However, the absence of a commitment to abortion rights in the final statement, unlike the previous year's summit, highlighted divisions among the leaders.

        "body": "Marine Le Pen's anti-immigration National Rally is also seeking allies.\n\nLeaders of France's left-wing parties allied in a new coalition and outlined their plan on Friday to prevent the surging far right from taking power in upcoming snap national parliamentary elections.\n\nMarine Le Pen's anti-immigration National Rally is also seeking allies to boost its chances of becoming the first far-right force to lead the French government since the Nazi occupation.\n\nEmbattled President Emmanuel Macron on Friday called the alliances on both left and right \"crazy\" and incoherent.\n\nWhile differences between them remain, the leaders of the usually fractious French left-wing parties emphasised that all of them had compromised during four days of negotiations and aligned their views on issues such as the war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict to prevent a victory by Ms Le Pen's camp.\n\nVarious parties on the left, unions and anti-racism groups are also coming together on Saturday to hold protests in Paris and across the country against the far right.\n\nThe early legislative vote June 30 and July 7 was triggered by Mr Macron's decision on Sunday to dissolve the National Assembly, France's lower house of parliament, after his centrist party suffered a crushing defeat by the National Rally in the election for the European Parliament.\n\nThe far right is \"at the door of power\", leaders of the leftist alliance, named the New Popular Front, warned at a news conference.\n\nThey urged supporters to mobilise rather than despair, show up and cast their ballots.\n\n\"We are going to extinguish the flame of the National Rally,\" said Marine Tondelier, the national secretary of the Ecologists party. \"It's either us or them.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Jordan Bardella, the president of the National Rally, attended an event at a farm in the rural French village of Chuelles, emphasising the party's commitment to agricultural issues and rural voters. He highlighted the National Rally's plans to support French farmers and protect their interests against globalisation and EU regulations.\n\nIn addition to the environmentalist parties, the New Popular Front alliance, named after a similar coalition formed in the 1930s against the rise of fascism in France, also includes the French Socialists and Communists and the hard-left France Unbowed party of Jean-Luc Melenchon, who has been accused of an antisemitic stance in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nIf elected, they promised to repeal a controversial reform of unemployment benefits pushed by Mr Macron's government and reverse his deeply unpopular pension reform law that raised the retirement age from 62 to 64.\n\nThey also vowed to raise the minimum wage, adjust salaries and pensions with the inflation rate, and freeze food and energy prices to boost people's purchasing power.\n\n\"Our goal is to mark a clear break from Emmanuel Macron's policies to address people's immediate needs and set out our county on a vitally important environmental path,\" Manuel Bompard of the France Unbowed party said.\n\nThe leaders of the alliance's four main parties emphasised that there was no place for antisemitism within their ranks. On the conflict between Israel and Hamas, they said they have agreed to condemn the October 7 deadly Hamas-led incursion into southern Israel as \"terrorist massacres\" and demanded the release of all hostages held by the group in Gaza.\n\nThey also promised unwavering support for Ukraine and its defence against Russian aggression, although they vowed that no French troops would ever be sent to Ukraine to help its fight.\n\nMr Macron dismissed the new alliances as political manoeuvring that cannot paper over deep differences, notably over Ukraine and Gaza.\n\n\"We are dealing with crazy people. It's not serious,\" he said on the sidelines of a G-7 summit in Italy.\n\n\"We are at a moment of extreme gravity in the life of the country. There are stakes, with wars, with unprecedented economic challenges,\" he said.\n\n\"I have trust in (the people's) capacity to look at the projects on the table, and look seriously at whether these projects are bringing solutions for the future of the country and for them.\"",

        "title": "G7 leaders tackle migration, AI and economic security on final day of summit",
        "body": "The G7 leaders stressed their determination to meet global challenges \"at a crucial moment in history\".\n\nThe gathering in a luxury resort in Italy's southern Puglia region also discussed other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, the war in Gaza, climate change, Iran, the situation in the Red Sea, gender equality and China's industrial policy and economic security.\n\n\"We are working together and with others to address the pressing challenges of our time,\" the G7 leaders said in a final statement, noting their solidarity with Ukraine, support for a deal that would lead to an immediate ceasefire and release of hostages in Gaza, investment in sustainable infrastructure in Africa and commitments to address climate change and migration.\n\nDivisions did emerge during the summit, however, notably over the lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final declaration.\n\nAsked if the G7 gathering has lived up to expectations, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"The aim of the G7 is to create convergence and be able to remove misunderstandings. It's not a place where you decide emergency measures or regulate things.\" He added that there were \"true convergences on Ukraine and Mideast\".\n\n\"It was a useful G7, with useful results,\" Mr Macron said. \"The coming weeks will create the conditions for political opportunities in particular around the two conflicts.\"\n\nMigration was the first topic of discussions on Friday, with the leaders mulling ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.\n\nThe issue is of particular interest to summit host Italy, which lies on one of the major routes into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her hardline stance on migration, has been eager to increase investment and funding for African nations as a means of reducing migratory pressure on Europe.\n\nThe leaders \"launched the G7 Coalition to prevent and counter the smuggling of migrants\", the summit's final declaration said, noting the seven nations would \"focus on the root causes of irregular migration, efforts to enhance border management and curb transnational organised crime, and safe and regular pathways for migration\".\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he and Ms Meloni - whom he described as \"fantastic\" - saw \"eye to eye\" on migration.\n\n\"We can't have criminal gangs decide who comes to our countries,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\nMs Meloni has a controversial five-year deal with neighbouring Albania for the Balkan country to host thousands of asylum seekers while Italy processes their claims. She has also spearheaded the \"Mattei Plan\" for Africa, a continent-wide strategy to increase economic opportunities at home and so discourage migration.\n\nFor its part, Britain has a deal to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, although no flights have yet taken off. Human rights organisations have criticised the agreement as unethical and unworkable.\n\nThe United States has also been struggling with a growing number of migrants. President Joe Biden introduced new policies to curb migration after a Bill he tried to get through Congress failed to pass. However, the future of the new policies is unclear after immigrant rights advocates challenged them with lawsuits.\n\nApart from the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, the Italian hosts also invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Ms Meloni's migration and development initiatives.\n\nBut rights groups decried what they said was a lack of ambition in support for developing countries.\n\nThe ONE Campaign, which advocates for investment in Africa, said it had found the G7 and EU institutions' share of aid going to Africa was at its lowest point since 1973.\n\n\"Without any concrete action, the G7 in Italy amounts to no more than pointless platitudes,\" said David McNair, executive director at The ONE Campaign.\n\nAlthough the summit's final statement \"reflects promises of increased partnership between the G7 and Africa, there are very few specifics on what new financing, if any, will be available\".\n\nPope Francis also became the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, delivering a speech on artificial intelligence. Other invitees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe summit opened on Thursday with a strong show of support for Kyiv: an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion-dollar (£39.5 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denounced the freezing of Russian assets as \"theft\" and vowed it \"will not go unpunished\".\n\nMr Biden also signed a bilateral security agreement with Mr Zelensky, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv.\n\nBut some cracks appeared among the G7 leaders, notably Mr Macron deploring a lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final document.\n\nThe statement after last year's summit in Hiroshima, Japan, expressed a commitment to provide access to safe and legal abortion to women and girls, and pledged to defend gender equality and the rights of members of the LGBT+ community.\n\nThe word \"abortion\" was absent from this year's final communique, although it included a reference to promoting sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\n\"It was not possible to reach agreement on these things in the room,\" a senior EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the private discussions.\n\nAsked on Thursday about reports that abortion would not be included in the final text, Mr Macron said it was something he regretted.\n\nFrance \"has included women's right to abortion, the freedom of decision on one's own body, into its constitution\", he said, adding that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men\".\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" Mr Macron said.\n\nMs Meloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has denied she is rolling back rights to abortions, which have been legal in Italy since 1978. But the centre-left opposition has warned that her initiatives are chipping away at those rights, including by giving pro-life groups access to women considering abortions.",

        "body": "Following intense pressure, school pauses search for Holocaust center director until 2025-26 academic year\n\nThe University of Minnesota has rescinded an offer to run its Center of Holocaust and Genocide Studies to an anti-Israel scholar who has accused the Jewish state of genocide and downplayed anti-Semitism on U.S. college campuses. But that scholar, Stockton University's Raz Segal, could still join the school as a faculty member.\n\nUniversity of Minnesota interim president Jeff Ettinger announced the move during a Friday board meeting, saying the school \"will initiate a new international search\" for its next Holocaust center director during the \"25-26 academic year.\"\n\n\"No employment offers through the center's new director are currently outstanding,\" Ettinger said.\n\nThat announcement came roughly one week after the school offered the director job to Segal, who accused Israel of genocide just six days after Hamas terrorists infiltrated the Jewish state and slaughtered scores of civilians. The offer prompted immediate pushback from members of the Holocaust center's advisory board, with two members resigning in protest, the Washington Free Beacon reported.\n\nWhile Segal will no longer lead the center, he is still considering a faculty appointment to the University of Minnesota's history department. That role was a part of the school's initial offer to Segal, and after the school paused his Holocaust center director appointment, Segal \"received a call from the university provost offering him an academic position in the history department without directorship of the center,\" according to the Sahan Journal.\n\n\"He said he is still interested in the academic position, though he has not yet received a revised job offer,\" the outlet reported.\n\nA university spokeswoman, Andria Waclawski, said Ettinger's Friday comments were \"specifically about only the director role, not a faculty position,\" leaving the door open for Segal to join the school's history department.\n\nThe ordeal comes as the public university grapples with high-profile anti-Semitic incidents, as well as a federal probe into complaints of anti-Semitism at the school.\n\nLast week, for example, the University of Minnesota Hillel building saw its windows smashed in an act of vandalism. In January, meanwhile, the Biden administration launched an investigation into the school after faculty departments within the College of Liberal Arts posted anti-Israel statements to their websites.\n\nSegal, who did not respond to a request for comment, has rallied against the Jewish state in the wake of the Oct. 7 terror attack.\n\nIn an Oct. 13 op-ed, published in Jewish Currents, he referred to Israel's \"assault on Gaza\" as \"textbook case of genocide unfolding in front of our eyes.\"\n\n\"I say this as a scholar of genocide, who has spent many years writing about Israeli mass violence against Palestinians,\" Segal wrote. \"I have written about settler colonialism and Jewish supremacy in Israel, the distortion of the Holocaust to boost the Israeli arms industry, the weaponization of antisemitism accusations to justify Israeli violence against Palestinians, and the racist regime of Israeli apartheid. Now, following Hamas's attack on Saturday and the mass murder of more than 1,000 Israeli civilians, the worst of the worst is happening.\"\n\nIn a May interview with NJ Spotlight News, meanwhile, Segal dismissed complaints from Jewish students regarding campus safety amid unauthorized anti-Israel protests. Such complaints are \"baseless,\" Segal wrote, adding that student protesters \"aren't escalating anything\" and are subject to \"a vicious police attack against them.\" In a January Los Angeles Times article, he argued that the creation of the Jewish state \"reproduced the racism and white supremacy that had targeted Jews for exclusion.\"\n\nSegal's subsequent appointment as Holocaust center head prompted two members of the center's advisory board -- music professor Karen Painter and French professor Bruno Chaouat -- to resign immediately.\n\nPainter told the Free Beacon she requested to rejoin the board as soon as she learned the search for a new director was paused. She confirmed Segal \"still has an offer from the Provost to teach in the history department.\"\n\n\"I requested to rejoin the board as soon as I learned that the search was paused,\" Painter said. \"Both Holocaust experts resigned from the board, and we owe it to the university and the field to provide our expertise.\"\n\nChaouat, meanwhile, told the Free Beacon that no one has invited him to rejoin the board -- or acknowledged his resignation.\n\n\"No one has invited me to rejoin the board, and in fact no one acknowledged my resignation. I have become invisible on campus,\" he said.\n\nDuring Friday's meeting, Ettinger said the new search for a Holocaust center director would include a \"robust community engagement plan ... including the participation of community members on the search committee.\" The search committee that spearheaded Segal's appointment excluded representation from Jewish stakeholders, the Free Beacon reported.\n\n\"The committee was made up of faculty and staff, including members of the center's advisory board who have academic expertise in this area,\" Ettinger said Friday. \"But unlike in the previous search for this position, there were no community members named to serve on the committee.\"",

He highlighted the National Rally's plans to support French farmers and protect their interests against globalisation and EU regulations.\n\nIn addition to the environmentalist parties, the New Popular Front alliance, named after a similar coalition formed in the 1930s against the rise of fascism in France, also includes the French Socialists and Communists and the hard-left France Unbowed party of Jean-Luc Melenchon, who has been accused of an antisemitic stance in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nIf elected, they promised to repeal a controversial reform of unemployment benefits pushed by Mr Macron's government and reverse his deeply unpopular pension reform law that raised the retirement age from 62 to 64.\n\nThey also vowed to raise the minimum wage, adjust salaries and pensions with the inflation rate, and freeze food and energy prices to boost people's purchasing power.\n\n\"Our goal is to mark a clear break from Emmanuel Macron's policies to address people's immediate needs and set out our county on a vitally important environmental path,\" Manuel Bompard of the France Unbowed party said.\n\nThe leaders of the alliance's four main parties emphasised that there was no place for antisemitism within their ranks. On the conflict between Israel and Hamas, they said they have agreed to condemn the October 7 deadly Hamas-led incursion into southern Israel as \"terrorist massacres\" and demanded the release of all hostages held by the group in Gaza.\n\nThey also promised unwavering support for Ukraine and its defence against Russian aggression, although they vowed that no French troops would ever be sent to Ukraine to help its fight.\n\nMr Macron dismissed the new alliances as political manoeuvring that cannot paper over deep differences, notably over Ukraine and Gaza.\n\n\"We are dealing with crazy people. It's not serious,\" he said on the sidelines of a G-7 summit in Italy.\n\n\"We are at a moment of extreme gravity in the life of the country. There are stakes, with wars, with unprecedented economic challenges,\" he said.\n\n\"I have trust in (the people's) capacity to look at the projects on the table, and look seriously at whether these projects are bringing solutions for the future of the country and for them.\"",

The elections were triggered by Macron dissolving the National Assembly after his party's defeat in the European Parliament elections.",

        "body": "The deal, which parties referred to as a government of national unity, will bring the ANC together in government with the Democratic Alliance (DA), a white-led party that had for years been the main opposition and a fierce foe for the ANC.\n\nAt least two other smaller parties will also be part of the agreement that put South Africa into uncharted waters with the first national coalition government in its democratic history.\n\n\"The government of national unity is on track,\" ANC secretary-general Fikile Mbalula said. \"For the interest of the country, we said let's work together. We have no fear of that.\"\n\nThe agreement was necessary after the ANC lost its 30-year majority in a humbling national election for it last month. It was a turning point for Africa's most industrialised economy. The ANC is the party of Nelson Mandela and had governed with a comfortable majority ever since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994.\n\nThat three-decade dominance ended in the May 29 election, when the ANC's share of the vote dropped to 40% amid discontent from South Africans over high levels of poverty, inequality and unemployment.\n\nAll the parties have said they would put their differences aside to work in the best interests of the country.\n\nHowever, analysts warned there might be complications ahead given the starkly different ideologies of the ANC, a former liberation movement, and the centrist, business-friendly DA -- the two biggest parties and the key players. The DA won 21% of the vote in the national election, the second largest share.\n\nFor one, the DA disagreed with the ANC government's move to accuse Israel of genocide in Gaza in a highly sensitive case at the United Nations' top court.\n\nDA leader John Steenhuisen was the first to confirm that an agreement was dramatically signed on Friday when Parliament was in a break.\n\n\"From today, the DA will co-govern the Republic of South Africa in a spirit of unity and collaboration,\" Mr Steenhuisen said as he broke away from the proceedings to make a speech that was carried live on television. He called it an \"historic step forward.\"\n\nMr Steenhuisen said the DA would back the 71-year-old Mr Ramaphosa for president and because the two parties have a clear joint majority of seats in Parliament, Mr Ramaphosa's re-election now appeared to be assured.\n\nThe Parliament session first went through the hours-long swearing-in of hundreds of new MPs and electing a speaker and a deputy speaker, before the house set to vote on the president, well into the night. Two candidates were nominated -- Mr Ramaphosa and Julius Malema, the leader of the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters party which had refused to join the unity government.\n\nA majority of the votes cast in a secret ballot in the 400-member lower house of Parliament, called the National Assembly, was required to elect a president.\n\nFormer President Jacob Zuma's MK Party was boycotting the session, which did not after the voting as only a third of the house is needed for a quorum.\n\nParliament convened in an unusual setting after a fire in 2022 gutted the National Assembly building in Cape Town and lawmakers came together at a conference centre near the city's waterfront.\n\nTwo other smaller parties said they would be part of the coalition agreement and Mr Mbalula said the ANC was open to talking with anyone else who wanted to join the unity government.\n\nThere are 18 political parties represented in Parliament and Mr Mbalula said the multi-party agreement would \"prioritise the country across the political and ideological divide\". Some parties refused to join.\n\nThe other two parties to join were the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Patriotic Alliance, which has drawn attention because of its strong anti-immigration stance and because its leader, Gayton McKenzie, served a prison sentence for bank robbery.\n\n\"The deal is we are putting South Africa first,\" Mr McKenzie said in an interview on state broadcaster SABC. \"We are going to work together. We have decided we are not going to let South Africa die in our hands, on our watch.\"\n\nThe ANC had faced a deadline to get a coalition agreement given parliament had to sit for the first time and vote for the president within 14 days of the election results being declared on June 2.\n\nThe ANC had been trying to strike a coalition agreement for two weeks and the final negotiations went through the night Thursday and into Friday, party officials said.\n\nSouth Africa had not faced this level of political uncertainty since the ANC swept to power in the first all-race election in 1994 that ended nearly a half-century of racial segregation.\n\nThe party had held a clear majority in parliament since then, meaning parliamentary votes for the president were formalities and every South African leader since had been from the ANC, starting with Mr Mandela.\n\nThis unity government also harked back to the way Mr Mandela, South Africa's first black president, invited political opponents to be part of a new unity government in 1994 in an act of reconciliation. The ANC's hand was forced this time.\n\n\"The ANC has been very magnanimous in that they have accepted defeat and have said, 'let's talk',\" PA leader Mr McKenzie said.",

        "summary": "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is set for re-election following a historic coalition agreement between the African National Congress (ANC) and the Democratic Alliance (DA), along with at least two smaller parties. This coalition, termed a government of national unity, marks the first national coalition government in South Africa's democratic history. The agreement was necessitated after the ANC lost its 30-year majority in a recent election, securing only 40% of the vote amid widespread discontent over poverty, inequality, and unemployment.\n\nKey figures include ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula, DA leader John Steenhuisen, and Patriotic Alliance leader Gayton McKenzie. The DA, which won 21% of the vote, has agreed to support Ramaphosa for president, ensuring his re-election due to their combined majority in Parliament. The coalition aims to prioritize national interests despite ideological differences, particularly between the ANC and the centrist, business-friendly DA.\n\nThe coalition agreement was finalized just before the parliamentary deadline, following intense negotiations. Parliament convened in a temporary location due to a fire in the National Assembly building. The session included the swearing-in of new MPs and the election of parliamentary leaders before the presidential vote. Former President Jacob Zuma's MK Party boycotted the session, while the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters, led by Julius Malema, refused to join the unity government.\n\nThis coalition government is reminiscent of Nelson Mandela's inclusive approach in 1994 but was driven by the ANC's recent electoral defeat. The agreement aims to stabilize South Africa's political landscape and address pressing national issues.",

        "summary": "The Izmir Metropolitan Municipality in Türkiye has unanimously approved a proposal to designate Izmir as a sister city to Gaza. The decision, made during a regular city council meeting led by Mayor Cemil Tugay, aims to show solidarity with Gaza and support its residents. Tugay expressed hope for peace and the cessation of attacks on Gaza. The sister city agreement will proceed pending legal processes and Gaza's approval. This decision comes amid ongoing international condemnation of Israel's offensive on Gaza, which has resulted in over 37,300 Palestinian deaths and significant destruction. Israel faces accusations of genocide and a UN Security Council resolution demands an immediate cease-fire.",

        "body": "Female hostages still in Gaza are being kept as slaves just like Noa Argamani, the mother of one of the youngest women captives has warned.\n\nShira Albag has told how her 19-year-old daughter Liri is being forced to cook and clean for her captors after being kidnapped on October 7.\n\nShe gave a moving testimony to female Israeli leaders today in light of Noa's own account of how she was held in domestic servitude for eight months.\n\n'Noa said that they were slaves, and so were the [IDF] observers, Liri among them,' Ms Albag said. 'They cleaned their yard, did dishes, and prepared food they couldn't eat.'\n\nShe quipped that Liri, who remains in the Gaza Strip, was held in a 'luxury villa' where they let her shower - but only after a month in captivity.\n\n'After 40 days, they took her down to the tunnels. It's much worse. There is only salt water and not much food. No clothes to change into,' she added.\n\nIt comes as an Israeli special forces soldier who embarked on the heroic rescue of Noa revealed her first thoughts were for her terminally ill mother Liora, despite being held captive without daylight for 245 days.\n\nThe special forces operator said Noa's first words after being saved were: 'Is my mother still alive?'\n\nAfter 245 days in captivity, Noa Argamani was rescued in an IDF raid that also freed three male captives. She is seen here hugging her father after they were reunited on Saturday\n\nNoa is pictured embracing Ditza Or, the mother of her boyfriend Avinatan Or, who was also taken hostage by Hamas on October 7\n\nNoa Argamani speaks on the phone with Israeli president Isaac Herzog on Saturday\n\nNoa has been reunited with her mother Liora Argamani (right), who has stage four brain cancer\n\nLiora had reached out to US president Joe Biden urging him to help rescue her daughter\n\nNoa Argamani is pictured being kidnapped and driven across the desert\n\nAn Israeli special forces soldier who rescued Noa revealed that her first thoughts were for her terminally ill mother, Liora, despite being held captive without daylight for 245 days\n\nShira Albag (L), the mother of IDF soldier Liri (R), today told Israeli media that Noa explained how their Hamas captors forced them to cook and clean and refused to let them bathe\n\nMembers of the Yamam counter-terror unit that specialises in hostage rescue revealed the emotional exchange in their first interview since last week's rescue, which was published today in Israel.\n\nElite fighters last week stormed the building where 26-year-old Noa was held and told her: 'Noa, we're here to save you. We're here to bring you home.\n\n'The first question she asked was, 'Is my mother still alive?' he told Israeli army radio channel Galatz.\n\n'I said yes, she looked at everyone and then she asked, \"Are you sure?\" We said, \"Yes, Noa, we're here to bring you back to your mother\".'\n\nHe added: 'She was very frightened, very scared, but she co-operated. She was barefooted. One of the fighters put her on his back and then put her down on in the car.'\n\nThe vehicle then raced for the beach where a helicopter was due to evacuate them, but the car got stuck when a huge firefight erupted.\n\nThey managed to fight off the terrorists and get the vehicle moving again before making the rendezvous point in the nick of time.\n\n'In the car she was still in shock,' the fighter said. 'She still didn't understand what was going on and then she said, 'I'm still a little scared of the road.'\n\n'But at least we understood that she was already communicating with us in a good way. One of the fighters also gave her a piece of candy to try and reduce her stress.'\n\nNoa was saved along with 21-year-old Almog Meir Jan, Andrey Kozlov, 27, and Shlomi Ziv, 40, all of whom were kidnapped from the Nova Festival on October 7.\n\nNoa Argamani is reunited with her father following the audacious rescue of four Israeli hostages in Operation Arnon\n\nA screen displays a picture of Noa Argamani who was kidnapped during the deadly October 7 attack and, according to the military, rescued by the Israeli forces, amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, in Tel Aviv, Israel June 10, 2024\n\nArgamani was famously seen in a video begging the terrorists not to kill her as she was dragged away on the back of a motorcycle\n\nUnbeknownst to her, Argamani became an icon of the struggle to free the hostages during her time in captivity after the video of her kidnapping went around the world\n\nOne soldier from the Israeli rescue unit, Arnon Zmora, was shot in the head and killed rescuing the three men who were held 200 metres from Noa.\n\nNoa has been tending to Liora, 61, who has stage four brain cancer, ever since the incredible rescue.\n\nThroughout her time in captivity, Liora made a series of heart-wrenching appeals to see her daughter prior to her death, and the pair enjoyed an emotional reunion in hospital hours after Noa landed.\n\nIsrael first received intelligence of the four hostages' location in the Nuseirat refugee camp, central Gaza, on May 12.\n\nA team of undercover operatives were dispatched to smuggle themselves into the area and gather more information, the Jewish Chronicle reported.\n\nA team of undercover soldiers, including women in hijabs, then arrived in the area pretending to be two Gazan families fleeing Israeli bombing.\n\nThey pointed to the building where Noa was being held and offered a huge sum of cash to get a house, managing to secure a location on the same street within three hours.\n\nSpecial forces made up of undercover operatives of Yamam and Shin Bet surround one of two heavily guarded buildings in Al Nuseirat, Gaza\n\nHelmet cam footage showed how the Israeli operators rescued the hostages\n\nHaving set up a base just 800 metres from where the hostages were being held, the Israeli operatives fed information back to Israel that allowed Yamam fighters to prepare.\n\n'We knew it was a girl, a hostage - we didn't know who exactly it was until a day or two before the operation,' one of the Yamam fighters said.\n\nOn learning Noa's identity they had to clear their mind of her emotional personal story.\n\n'I was exposed to the fact that her mother was in hospital in a critical condition,' another of the unit said. 'I didn't know that and it got to me a little.\n\n'I'm trying to put it aside because my goal is to be focussed on the mission and that nothing will affect my decisions on the ground.'\n\nNoa arrived home on the 69th birthday of her father Yaakov.\n\nShe appeared in good physical shape but medics have warned the road to mental recovery is long.",

The bank had said the week before that it did not invest its own money in companies that supply weapons used by Israel in Gaza.\n\n(Reporting by Angela Christy and Mrinmay Dey in Bengaluru; Editing by Alan Barona)",

Xinhua reported that there were twenty Filipino people on the ship, with authorities saying that at least one crew member has not been accounted for yet.\n\nThe Philippines' Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) stated, according to China Daily, that \"the Philippine government will take all necessary measures to secure the safety and well-being of the Filipino crew on board and ensure justice. We call on all UN member states to protect the human rights of seafarers.\"\n\nSince November, the Houthis have carried out hundreds of drone and missile attacks on ships in the Red Sea, the Bab al-Mandab Strait, and the Gulf of Aden. They have said that they are acting in sympathy with Palestinians who are under bombardment amid the Israeli aggression on Gaza.\n\nAs reported by Reuters, a person with insight into the situation said that Tsavliris Salvage Group has been tasked with the responsibility of towing the ship, which is transporting 80,000 tons of coal. There will be two boats involved in the endeavor, with the first one anticipated to arrive at Tutor on Monday morning, while the second one to arrive on Tuesday evening.",

        "summary": "The Israeli army announced that its jet fighters struck multiple Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon late Friday. The strikes were in response to a Hezbollah rocket attack on northern Israel, specifically targeting the Avivim settlement area. The Israeli military hit a rocket launcher in Yaroun, a weapons depot in Houla, and other military infrastructure in Aitaroun. Earlier, 10 rockets were fired from southern Lebanon towards the Metula settlement, triggering sirens but causing no casualties. These events have escalated tensions between Hezbollah and Israel, particularly following the killing of Hezbollah leader Taleb Sami Abdallah in an Israeli airstrike on Tuesday. The situation is further complicated by ongoing cross-border attacks amid Israel's offensive on the Gaza Strip.",

        "body": "Leaders of France's left-wing parties allied in a new coalition and outlined their plan on Friday to prevent the surging far right from taking power in upcoming snap national parliamentary elections.\n\nMarine Le Pen's anti-immigration National Rally is also seeking allies to boost its chances of becoming the first far-right force to lead the French government since the Nazi occupation.\n\nEmbattled President Emmanuel Macron on Friday called the alliances on both left and right \"crazy\" and incoherent.\n\nWhile differences between them remain, the leaders of the usually fractious French left-wing parties emphasised that all of them had compromised during four days of negotiations and aligned their views on issues such as the war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict to prevent a victory by Ms Le Pen's camp.\n\nThe early legislative vote June 30 and July 7 was triggered by Mr Macron's decision on Sunday to dissolve the National Assembly, France's lower house of parliament, after his centrist party suffered a crushing defeat by the National Rally in the election for the European Parliament.\n\nThe far right is \"at the door of power\", leaders of the leftist alliance, named the New Popular Front, warned at a news conference.\n\nThey urged supporters to mobilise rather than despair, show up and cast their ballots.\n\n\"We are going to extinguish the flame of the National Rally,\" said Marine Tondelier, the national secretary of the Ecologists party. \"It's either us or them.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Jordan Bardella, the president of the National Rally, attended an event at a farm in the rural French village of Chuelles, emphasising the party's commitment to agricultural issues and rural voters. He highlighted the National Rally's plans to support French farmers and protect their interests against globalisation and EU regulations.\n\nIf elected, they promised to repeal a controversial reform of unemployment benefits pushed by Mr Macron's government and reverse his deeply unpopular pension reform law that raised the retirement age from 62 to 64.\n\nThey also vowed to raise the minimum wage, adjust salaries and pensions with the inflation rate, and freeze food and energy prices to boost people's purchasing power.\n\n\"Our goal is to mark a clear break from Emmanuel Macron's policies to address people's immediate needs and set out our county on a vitally important environmental path,\" Manuel Bompard of the France Unbowed party said.\n\nThe leaders of the alliance's four main parties emphasised that there was no place for antisemitism within their ranks. On the conflict between Israel and Hamas, they said they have agreed to condemn the October 7 deadly Hamas-led incursion into southern Israel as \"terrorist massacres\" and demanded the release of all hostages held by the group in Gaza.\n\nMr Macron dismissed the new alliances as political manoeuvring that cannot paper over deep differences, notably over Ukraine and Gaza.\n\n\"We are dealing with crazy people. It's not serious,\" he said on the sidelines of a G-7 summit in Italy.\n\n\"We are at a moment of extreme gravity in the life of the country. There are stakes, with wars, with unprecedented economic challenges,\" he said.\n\n\"I have trust in (the people's) capacity to look at the projects on the table, and look seriously at whether these projects are bringing solutions for the future of the country and for them.\"",

        "title": "G7 leaders tackle migration, AI and economic security on final day of summit",
        "body": "The G7 leaders stressed their determination to meet global challenges \"at a crucial moment in history\".\n\nThe gathering in a luxury resort in Italy's southern Puglia region also discussed other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, the war in Gaza, climate change, Iran, the situation in the Red Sea, gender equality and China's industrial policy and economic security.\n\n\"We are working together and with others to address the pressing challenges of our time,\" the G7 leaders said in a final statement, noting their solidarity with Ukraine, support for a deal that would lead to an immediate ceasefire and release of hostages in Gaza, investment in sustainable infrastructure in Africa and commitments to address climate change and migration.\n\nDivisions did emerge during the summit, however, notably over the lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final declaration.\n\nAsked if the G7 gathering has lived up to expectations, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"The aim of the G7 is to create convergence and be able to remove misunderstandings. It's not a place where you decide emergency measures or regulate things.\" He added that there were \"true convergences on Ukraine and Mideast\".\n\n\"It was a useful G7, with useful results,\" Mr Macron said. \"The coming weeks will create the conditions for political opportunities in particular around the two conflicts.\"\n\nMigration was the first topic of discussions on Friday, with the leaders mulling ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.\n\nThe issue is of particular interest to summit host Italy, which lies on one of the major routes into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her hardline stance on migration, has been eager to increase investment and funding for African nations as a means of reducing migratory pressure on Europe.\n\nThe leaders \"launched the G7 Coalition to prevent and counter the smuggling of migrants\", the summit's final declaration said, noting the seven nations would \"focus on the root causes of irregular migration, efforts to enhance border management and curb transnational organised crime, and safe and regular pathways for migration\".\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he and Ms Meloni - whom he described as \"fantastic\" - saw \"eye to eye\" on migration.\n\n\"We can't have criminal gangs decide who comes to our countries,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\nMs Meloni has a controversial five-year deal with neighbouring Albania for the Balkan country to host thousands of asylum seekers while Italy processes their claims. She has also spearheaded the \"Mattei Plan\" for Africa, a continent-wide strategy to increase economic opportunities at home and so discourage migration.\n\nFor its part, Britain has a deal to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, although no flights have yet taken off. Human rights organisations have criticised the agreement as unethical and unworkable.\n\nThe United States has also been struggling with a growing number of migrants. President Joe Biden introduced new policies to curb migration after a Bill he tried to get through Congress failed to pass. However, the future of the new policies is unclear after immigrant rights advocates challenged them with lawsuits.\n\nApart from the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, the Italian hosts also invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Ms Meloni's migration and development initiatives.\n\nBut rights groups decried what they said was a lack of ambition in support for developing countries.\n\nThe ONE Campaign, which advocates for investment in Africa, said it had found the G7 and EU institutions' share of aid going to Africa was at its lowest point since 1973.\n\n\"Without any concrete action, the G7 in Italy amounts to no more than pointless platitudes,\" said David McNair, executive director at The ONE Campaign.\n\nAlthough the summit's final statement \"reflects promises of increased partnership between the G7 and Africa, there are very few specifics on what new financing, if any, will be available\".\n\nPope Francis also became the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, delivering a speech on artificial intelligence. Other invitees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe summit opened on Thursday with a strong show of support for Kyiv: an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion-dollar (£39.5 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denounced the freezing of Russian assets as \"theft\" and vowed it \"will not go unpunished\".\n\nMr Biden also signed a bilateral security agreement with Mr Zelensky, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv.\n\nBut some cracks appeared among the G7 leaders, notably Mr Macron deploring a lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final document.\n\nThe statement after last year's summit in Hiroshima, Japan, expressed a commitment to provide access to safe and legal abortion to women and girls, and pledged to defend gender equality and the rights of members of the LGBT+ community.\n\nThe word \"abortion\" was absent from this year's final communique, although it included a reference to promoting sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\n\"It was not possible to reach agreement on these things in the room,\" a senior EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the private discussions.\n\nAsked on Thursday about reports that abortion would not be included in the final text, Mr Macron said it was something he regretted.\n\nFrance \"has included women's right to abortion, the freedom of decision on one's own body, into its constitution\", he said, adding that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men\".\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" Mr Macron said.\n\nMs Meloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has denied she is rolling back rights to abortions, which have been legal in Italy since 1978. But the centre-left opposition has warned that her initiatives are chipping away at those rights, including by giving pro-life groups access to women considering abortions.",

        "summary": "The G7 summit in Italy concluded with leaders addressing key global issues such as migration, artificial intelligence, economic security, and financial support for Ukraine. The leaders emphasized their commitment to tackling these challenges collectively, highlighting solidarity with Ukraine, advocating for a ceasefire in Gaza, and investing in sustainable infrastructure in Africa. \n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her strict migration policies, pushed for increased investment in African nations to reduce migratory pressures on Europe. The G7 launched a coalition to combat migrant smuggling and address the root causes of irregular migration. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak supported Meloni's stance, emphasizing the need to prevent criminal gangs from controlling migration.\n\nThe summit also saw the first-ever address by Pope Francis, who spoke on artificial intelligence. Other notable attendees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who secured a $50 billion loan agreement for Ukraine backed by frozen Russian assets, a move condemned by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nDespite overall cooperation, divisions emerged, particularly over the absence of a reference to abortion in the final declaration, a point lamented by French President Emmanuel Macron. Rights groups criticized the summit for lacking concrete actions to support developing countries, particularly in Africa.\n\nIn summary, the G7 summit focused on global challenges with significant discussions on migration, economic security, and support for Ukraine, but faced criticism for insufficient commitments to developing nations and internal disagreements on social issues like abortion.",

        "title": "Who are the Israelis who moved to Georgia?",
        "body": "TBILISI, Georgia -- In the ancient land of khachapuri cheese bread and famous qvevri wine fermented in earthenware vessels, Danny Licht now offers a rival ethnic delicacy: falafel.\n\nThree years ago, the Swiss-Israeli entrepreneur moved here from Jerusalem with his Russian-born wife, Rita. In January, they opened Ashkara Falafel in the heart of Tbilisi's tourist district.\n\n\"We wanted to offer something fresh, tasty and inexpensive -- not a restaurant but real street food,\" said Licht, who charges 19 lari (about $7) for a complete falafel meal with all the fixings.\n\nMeanwhile, Rita, who has a doctorate in molecular genetics from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, runs a contemporary art gallery housed in the same building as their residence.\n\n\"We don't have any family ties here, but we love the culture and we have a passion for art,\" she said. \"Our dream was to open a gallery, and this is one of the places we could make it happen.\"\n\nDanny and Rita Licht are among 200 or so Israelis for whom Georgia -- a former Soviet republic about three hours' flying time from Tel Aviv -- is a new promised land. Frustrated with Israel's high prices, toxic politics and worsening security situation, they've decided to relocate permanently to this mountainous, landlocked country in the Caucasus.\n\nThey may have left behind one divided country for another. For the last two months, Georgia has experienced massive anti-government protests against a new law, modeled after one in Russia, that requires any organization receiving more than 20% of its funding from overseas to register as a \"foreign agent.\"\n\nCritics say the law is aimed at stifling dissent while moving the country closer to Moscow and away from the European Union. Polls show that 80% of Georgians want their country to join the EU, and protesters vow not to back down until the law -- which they say smacks of Putin-like repression -- is repealed.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the new law or the backlash have any effect on Israeli tourism, which has long been strong. Last year, according to government statistics, 217,065 Israelis visited Georgia, making them the fourth-largest source of foreign tourism after Russia, Turkey and Armenia. But Israelis stayed longer and spent an average 3,782 lari (about $1,400) per visit -- far more than any other group. It's not uncommon to hear Hebrew in the streets, and one of Tbilisi's top tourist attractions is the Museum of Georgian Jewish History, which chronicles 2,600 years of Jewish life in this country.\n\nAll told, Israeli investment in tourism, finance, agriculture and healthcare already totals around $500 million, said Itsik Moshe, founder of both Israeli House and the Israel-Georgia Chamber of Business.\n\n\"Georgia is a small country, but it's one of Israel's best friends in the world,\" said Moshe, who in 1990 became the first Israeli to represent the Jewish Agency in the former Soviet Union. \"We are two ancient peoples with difficult histories and the same fate. According to Georgian history, it was the Jews who helped prepare them to adopt Christianity.\"\n\nIn fact, legend has it that a Georgian Jew called Elias brought the robe of Jesus Christ back home from Jerusalem after the crucifixion, having acquired it from a Roman soldier at Golgotha.\n\nBefore Oct. 7, four or five airlines were offering nonstop flights between Tel Aviv and Tbilisi -- sometimes two flights a day by the same airline. Even now, El Al and Israir still offer daily service on that route. And posters of Israelis kidnapped by Hamas and held captive in Gaza are plastered on billboards and the sides of buses in Tbilisi.\n\nAnimosity still prevalent\n\nDespite the warm feelings, not everyone here loves Jews or Israel.\n\nIn November 2022, Pakistani agents affiliated with al-Qaeda and sent by Iran's Revolutionary Guards Quds Force attempted to assassinate Moshe on the street, in front of the Israeli flag over his office. Fortunately, the plot was discovered by local security officials, who arrested several suspects including two Georgian-Iranian dual citizens.\n\nMoshe, who remains closely guarded, said he expects a record 250,000 Israelis in Georgia in 2024. In November, his organization is planning a business conference in Tbilisi to mark 35 years of bilateral commercial ties.\n\nIn fact, many Israelis have purchased timeshares in the Black Sea resort of Batumi, and the country is considered a prime destination for skiing and hiking as well as travel focused on food and wine. Also unique to Georgia are its ancient 33-letter alphabet, which is nearly 1,500 years old, as well as its hauntingly beautiful chant, the traditional music sung in the Georgian Orthodox Church for daily and weekly services in three-voiced polyphony without instruments.\n\n\"I haven't met even one Israeli tourist who doesn't want to come back here,\" said Moshe, estimating Georgia's native Jewish population at 500 to 1,000; the Great Synagogue of Tbilisi serves the predominantly elderly community. In addition to those Israeli Jews who have moved to Georgia, there's also 1,500 Israeli Arabs -- mainly Christians from Nazareth and elsewhere -- studying medicine here.\n\nLikewise, Israel is home to roughly 120,000 Jews from Georgia. Known in Hebrew as gruzinim, they originally settled in Ashdod, Beersheba, Ashkelon and Haifa, though they've since spread throughout the country -- and a few have even returned.\n\nIlana Slutsky, a native of Orenburg in southern Russia, grew up in Haifa, and worked for years as an architect. The company that employed her landed a contract with a cardiovascular center in Georgia, which required her to travel there from Israel every 10 days over a four-year period.\n\nEventually, Slutsky moved to Tbilisi, and a few years ago she opened her own interior design, real estate and architectural consulting firm. Her Georgian husband, Tedo, is an artist, and she's currently in the process of restoring an apartment building from 1872.\n\nThe only time she felt unpleasant, she recalled, was seeing a recent Instagram post by Mutant Radio Tbilisi seeking donations for Palestinian children displaced by the war in Gaza.\n\n\"I feel sorry for all victims of war, but we know that this money will go directly to Hamas,\" said Slutsky, who understands the Georgian language as well as English, Hebrew and her native Russian. \"For me, it was disappointing, especially after what happened at the Nova music festival. To be honest, I was shocked.\"\n\nDespite the money they spend and the government's emulation of their native country, Russians aren't particularly welcome in Georgia, which seems awash in Ukrainian flags as a show of support for the fellow ex-Soviet republic. That's a legacy of the Russo-Georgian War of 2008, which began when pro-Russian separatists in the breakaway republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia attacked Georgia, violating a 1992 ceasefire agreement. The fighting ended 16 days later with Russia controlling a fifth of Georgian territory.\n\nAnti-Russian obscenities cover a retaining wall across the street from Danny Licht's falafel shop, and some nightclubs now make customers sign statements of support for Ukraine -- like Georgia, also a victim of Putin's aggression -- before they can enter the premises.\n\n\"When the Russia-Ukraine war started, Georgia was 30% or 40% cheaper than today,\" Licht said. \"But then apartment prices doubled and even tripled. The market went crazy because so many Russians ran away and came here. They couldn't use their credit cards in Russia anymore. And last September there was a [military] mobilization. They didn't come because they were against the war, but because they didn't want to be killed.\"\n\nLicht added: \"About half a year ago, prices reached a peak, and now they're coming down. But 20% of this country is still occupied by Russia, and Georgians are very suspicious of them.\"\n\nYaron Shmerkin, 39, has lived in Georgia nearly two years. Originally from Luhansk -- a city in eastern Ukraine that's been under Russian occupation for nearly a decade -- he's married to Georgian fashion designer Anuk Yosebashvili. Back in 2017, the jewelry designer, who specializes in Judaica art, took a Jeep trip with his wife and in-laws throughout the mountain republic, which is three times the size of Israel yet has less than half its population.\n\n\"After a week, I said, 'We're going to move here,'\" he recalled. \"We are very happy in Georgia.\"\n\nSo is Mikhail Gilichinski, 40, an Orthodox Jew and a native of the Russian city of Tula. He lived throughout Israel -- Kibbutz Bar'am, Jerusalem and Ramat Gan -- before coming to Georgia five years ago with his Moscow-born wife, Miriam. Both had been here on vacation previously.\n\nNeither Mikhail nor Miriam Gilichinski speak Georgian. They use English to communicate with locals because, he says, \"I don't feel comfortable speaking Russian with them.\"\n\nNevertheless, Gilichinski has built a small hotel, which his wife runs as an Airbnb. Their children, 10 and 7, attend the local Chabad religious school.\n\n\"I'm a jewelry designer and can work from anywhere,\" he said. \"We love Israel, but financially it's difficult. You have to work all the time, from morning to evening. That's why we came here.\"",

        "summary": "The article discusses the growing Israeli community in Georgia, highlighting individuals like Danny and Rita Licht, who moved from Jerusalem to Tbilisi three years ago. Danny opened Ashkara Falafel, a street food outlet, while Rita runs an art gallery. They are part of a wave of around 200 Israelis relocating to Georgia, attracted by lower costs and a different political climate compared to Israel.\n\nGeorgia, a former Soviet republic, has seen significant Israeli investment in various sectors, totaling around $500 million. Despite the warm bilateral relations, the country is currently experiencing anti-government protests against a new law perceived as pro-Russian and anti-EU. This political tension may impact Israeli tourism, which has been robust, with 217,065 Israeli visitors last year.\n\nThe article also touches on the mixed sentiments towards Jews and Israel in Georgia, citing an assassination attempt on Itsik Moshe, a prominent Israeli figure in Georgia. Additionally, the influx of Russians fleeing their country has driven up local prices, causing some friction.\n\nOverall, the Israeli community in Georgia is diverse, including professionals like Ilana Slutsky and Mikhail Gilichinski, who have found new opportunities and a different pace of life in the Caucasus region.",

        "title": "G7 leaders tackle migration, AI and economic security on final day of summit",
        "body": "The G7 leaders stressed their determination to meet global challenges \"at a crucial moment in history\".\n\nThe gathering in a luxury resort in Italy's southern Puglia region also discussed other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, the war in Gaza, climate change, Iran, the situation in the Red Sea, gender equality and China's industrial policy and economic security.\n\n\"We are working together and with others to address the pressing challenges of our time,\" the G7 leaders said in a final statement, noting their solidarity with Ukraine, support for a deal that would lead to an immediate ceasefire and release of hostages in Gaza, investment in sustainable infrastructure in Africa and commitments to address climate change and migration.\n\nDivisions did emerge during the summit, however, notably over the lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final declaration.\n\nAsked if the G7 gathering has lived up to expectations, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"The aim of the G7 is to create convergence and be able to remove misunderstandings. It's not a place where you decide emergency measures or regulate things.\" He added that there were \"true convergences on Ukraine and Mideast\".\n\n\"It was a useful G7, with useful results,\" Mr Macron said. \"The coming weeks will create the conditions for political opportunities in particular around the two conflicts.\"\n\nMigration was the first topic of discussions on Friday, with the leaders mulling ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.\n\nThe issue is of particular interest to summit host Italy, which lies on one of the major routes into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her hardline stance on migration, has been eager to increase investment and funding for African nations as a means of reducing migratory pressure on Europe.\n\nThe leaders \"launched the G7 Coalition to prevent and counter the smuggling of migrants\", the summit's final declaration said, noting the seven nations would \"focus on the root causes of irregular migration, efforts to enhance border management and curb transnational organised crime, and safe and regular pathways for migration\".\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he and Ms Meloni - whom he described as \"fantastic\" - saw \"eye to eye\" on migration.\n\n\"We can't have criminal gangs decide who comes to our countries,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\nMs Meloni has a controversial five-year deal with neighbouring Albania for the Balkan country to host thousands of asylum seekers while Italy processes their claims. She has also spearheaded the \"Mattei Plan\" for Africa, a continent-wide strategy to increase economic opportunities at home and so discourage migration.\n\nFor its part, Britain has a deal to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, although no flights have yet taken off. Human rights organisations have criticised the agreement as unethical and unworkable.\n\nThe United States has also been struggling with a growing number of migrants. President Joe Biden introduced new policies to curb migration after a Bill he tried to get through Congress failed to pass. However, the future of the new policies is unclear after immigrant rights advocates challenged them with lawsuits.\n\nApart from the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, the Italian hosts also invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Ms Meloni's migration and development initiatives.\n\nBut rights groups decried what they said was a lack of ambition in support for developing countries.\n\nThe ONE Campaign, which advocates for investment in Africa, said it had found the G7 and EU institutions' share of aid going to Africa was at its lowest point since 1973.\n\n\"Without any concrete action, the G7 in Italy amounts to no more than pointless platitudes,\" said David McNair, executive director at The ONE Campaign.\n\nAlthough the summit's final statement \"reflects promises of increased partnership between the G7 and Africa, there are very few specifics on what new financing, if any, will be available\".\n\nPope Francis also became the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, delivering a speech on artificial intelligence. Other invitees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe summit opened on Thursday with a strong show of support for Kyiv: an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion-dollar (£39.5 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denounced the freezing of Russian assets as \"theft\" and vowed it \"will not go unpunished\".\n\nMr Biden also signed a bilateral security agreement with Mr Zelensky, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv.\n\nBut some cracks appeared among the G7 leaders, notably Mr Macron deploring a lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final document.\n\nThe statement after last year's summit in Hiroshima, Japan, expressed a commitment to provide access to safe and legal abortion to women and girls, and pledged to defend gender equality and the rights of members of the LGBT+ community.\n\nThe word \"abortion\" was absent from this year's final communique, although it included a reference to promoting sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\n\"It was not possible to reach agreement on these things in the room,\" a senior EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the private discussions.\n\nAsked on Thursday about reports that abortion would not be included in the final text, Mr Macron said it was something he regretted.\n\nFrance \"has included women's right to abortion, the freedom of decision on one's own body, into its constitution\", he said, adding that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men\".\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" Mr Macron said.\n\nMs Meloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has denied she is rolling back rights to abortions, which have been legal in Italy since 1978. But the centre-left opposition has warned that her initiatives are chipping away at those rights, including by giving pro-life groups access to women considering abortions.",

        "title": "Biden's Gaza ceasefire push is a road to fatal escalation",
        "body": "Despite public calls to end the war in the Middle East, in reality all Washington is doing is encouraging a greater conflagration\n\nUS President Joe Biden's ceasefire push has so far led to further violence in Gaza and threatens to spill over into a war with Lebanon. Washington is either asleep at the wheel or is willing to push the entire region off a cliff in order to avoid ditching its \"unconditional support\" for Israel.\n\nThe speech delivered by Joe Biden on May 31, in which he presented an Israeli ceasefire proposal, urging both Hamas and the Israeli government to accept it, provided a glimpse of hope that finally the US was putting its foot down. The US President gave what seemed to be a reasonable roadmap to secure a lasting cessation of hostilities in Gaza and a prisoner exchange.\n\nThe immediate Hamas response was to view the speech \"positively,\" while still maintaining that it required an Israeli withdrawal of its forces from Gaza and a complete end to the war, in order to agree to any proposal. On the other hand, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, stuck with his previous rhetoric about the need to destroy Hamas, was indicating that he was not going to agree to a ceasefire.\n\nNetanyahu took things even further by asserting that Joe Biden's description of the Israeli ceasefire proposal was \"not accurate,\" also making it clear that there would be no ceasefire until his war goals were achieved. Giving legitimacy to the Israeli PM's assertions was an article published in The Economist that revealed details of the proposal, in which it became clear that the three-phase ceasefire would be more difficult to conclude, beyond its first phase, than Biden had let on.\n\nAlthough a series of articles have been released in the Western media, including a Reuters interview with an anonymous Biden administration official, portraying the president's actions as a bold attempt to pressure Israel to agree to its own proposal, it appears that this move is failing. As the daily death toll rises in besieged Gaza, the Israeli government continues to declare its intention to destroy Hamas, the Palestinian Party that it is supposedly about to conclude a deal with. This as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is being sent on yet another Middle East trip to try and help conclude a ceasefire deal as the effort nears collapse.\n\nIsrael, meanwhile, continues to escalate its assault on the southernmost Gazan city of Rafah, while renewing incursions and aerial assaults throughout the strip. All of this flies in the face of the International Court of Justice (ICJ)'s recent ruling that ordered Israel to halt its military operation in Rafah. On top of this, the tit-for-tat battles that have been going on since October between Hezbollah and the Israeli military along the Lebanese border, have also escalated to what many consider to be a point of no return; making a new Israel-Lebanon war nearly inevitable.\n\nAll of this is very reminiscent of what happened before, when Hamas announced, on May 6, that it had agreed to a ceasefire proposal. The proposal was admitted to be almost identical to the one that was repeatedly lauded by Antony Blinken as a \"strong\" deal during his last visit to the region.\n\nOn that same day, the Israeli military immediately launched its long-threatened offensive in southern Gaza, seizing the Rafah Crossing between the Palestinian territory and Egypt. At that time, the Israeli PM reiterated what he had been consistently saying beforehand about pursuing the destruction of Hamas and his government decided to signal their refusal to agree to the ceasefire.\n\nAgain, with the US now bringing forward Israel's own ceasefire proposal, the predicament does not seem to have changed much. Benjamin Netanyahu is in a difficult position domestically, after failing to achieve any of his war goals in Gaza, he faces the prospect of his governing coalition collapsing if he accepts a ceasefire agreement with nothing to show for eight months of war. The Israeli people also heavily favor re-occupying the strip, with 0% of Israeli Jews polled saying they would like to see Hamas continuing to govern the besieged coastal enclave after the war.\n\nTherefore, Netanyahu knows the political repercussions for him and others in the Israeli ruling class if he accepts a ceasefire agreement with Hamas. However, he also knows that, despite US pressure on his government to bring the war in Gaza to an end, the American government has no teeth behind its forceful statements and will indefinitely continue its \"unconditional support\" for Israel.\n\nNot only that, when the International Criminal Court (ICC)'s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, called for the issuance of arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, the US government threatened the court. US lawmakers immediately began to draft legislation to sanction the ICC. When the International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued its provisional rulings, as a result of the so-far successful South African genocide case against Israel, the US announced it disagreed with the conclusions.\n\nEven though the US abstained from a United Nations Security Council (UNSC) vote that called on Israel to halt its military operations in Gaza until the end of Muslim Holy month of Ramadan, the Biden administration illogically called the resolution \"non-binding\" and gave the Israelis the greenlight to violate it. American lawmakers have even just drafted legislation to condition aid to the Maldives, after that nation made an independent decision to stop Israeli citizens from entering their country due to war crimes committed in Gaza. Now the UN has added Israel to its infamous blacklist for killing Palestinian children, and the US has implemented another double-standard in continuing to provide weapons to a nation added to this list.\n\nDespite the mountains of reports of war crimes from international human rights groups, the decisions made by the UNSC, UN general assembly, the ICC and ICJ, the United States government works to protect the Israeli government at all costs. This has to be kept in mind when we look at the American approach to implementing \"red lines\" with their Israeli allies, which the Biden administration still cannot find the words to actually define. Even when it comes to the invasion of Rafah, which Washington openly said would be a \"disaster,\" it was simultaneously preparing another military aid package worth 14 billion dollars.\n\nUnderstanding all of this, Benjamin Netanyahu was still invited to Washington to address the US Congress and faced with some pressure to conclude a deal. He can rest assured that the Americans will stand by his side no matter what he chooses to do. So, if you are Netanyahu, what incentive is there to stop the war at this point? The Biden administration is filled to the brim with empty and vacuous strategies, which have led to public calls for ending the war, while privately refusing to ever hold Israel accountable.\n\nThe big problem this time around is that the continuation of the war will not only mean an escalation of the horrors in Gaza, but is heading towards a massive conflagration with Lebanon's Hezbollah. Unlike Hamas, Hezbollah possesses the missile capabilities to respond to Israeli airstrikes with devastating effect that could lead to the deaths of hundreds, even thousands, of Israelis. Under great domestic pressure to launch an assault on Lebanese territory, Benjamin Netanyahu appears to be closer to opening a catastrophic conflict with Lebanon, instead of concluding a ceasefire and prisoner exchange with Gaza. In his eyes, a war with Lebanon could even provide the perfect lethal distraction that would enable him to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza, but at the expense of triggering a much larger and deadlier war.",

        "summary": "US President Joe Biden's push for a ceasefire in Gaza has led to increased violence and risks escalating into a broader conflict with Lebanon. Despite Biden's May 31 speech proposing a ceasefire, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected it, insisting on continuing military operations until his goals are met. Hamas responded positively but demanded an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.\n\nNetanyahu's stance is bolstered by domestic support for re-occupying Gaza and political pressure to show results from the ongoing conflict. The US, despite public calls for peace, continues its \"unconditional support\" for Israel, undermining international efforts to hold Israel accountable for alleged war crimes. This includes threatening the International Criminal Court and dismissing UN resolutions.\n\nThe situation is further complicated by escalating skirmishes between Hezbollah and Israel along the Lebanese border, raising the specter of a larger, more devastating war. Netanyahu may see a conflict with Lebanon as a way to shift focus from Gaza, but this could lead to significant casualties and a broader regional crisis.",

        "title": "G7 leaders tackle migration, AI and economic security on final day of summit",
        "body": "The G7 leaders stressed their determination to meet global challenges \"at a crucial moment in history\".\n\nThe gathering in a luxury resort in Italy's southern Puglia region also discussed other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, the war in Gaza, climate change, Iran, the situation in the Red Sea, gender equality and China's industrial policy and economic security.\n\n\"We are working together and with others to address the pressing challenges of our time,\" the G7 leaders said in a final statement, noting their solidarity with Ukraine, support for a deal that would lead to an immediate ceasefire and release of hostages in Gaza, investment in sustainable infrastructure in Africa and commitments to address climate change and migration.\n\nDivisions did emerge during the summit, however, notably over the lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final declaration.\n\nAsked if the G7 gathering has lived up to expectations, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"The aim of the G7 is to create convergence and be able to remove misunderstandings. It's not a place where you decide emergency measures or regulate things.\" He added that there were \"true convergences on Ukraine and Mideast\".\n\n\"It was a useful G7, with useful results,\" Mr Macron said. \"The coming weeks will create the conditions for political opportunities in particular around the two conflicts.\"\n\nMigration was the first topic of discussions on Friday, with the leaders mulling ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.\n\nThe issue is of particular interest to summit host Italy, which lies on one of the major routes into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her hardline stance on migration, has been eager to increase investment and funding for African nations as a means of reducing migratory pressure on Europe.\n\nThe leaders \"launched the G7 Coalition to prevent and counter the smuggling of migrants\", the summit's final declaration said, noting the seven nations would \"focus on the root causes of irregular migration, efforts to enhance border management and curb transnational organised crime, and safe and regular pathways for migration\".\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he and Ms Meloni - whom he described as \"fantastic\" - saw \"eye to eye\" on migration.\n\n\"We can't have criminal gangs decide who comes to our countries,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\nMs Meloni has a controversial five-year deal with neighbouring Albania for the Balkan country to host thousands of asylum seekers while Italy processes their claims. She has also spearheaded the \"Mattei Plan\" for Africa, a continent-wide strategy to increase economic opportunities at home and so discourage migration.\n\nFor its part, Britain has a deal to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, although no flights have yet taken off. Human rights organisations have criticised the agreement as unethical and unworkable.\n\nThe United States has also been struggling with a growing number of migrants. President Joe Biden introduced new policies to curb migration after a Bill he tried to get through Congress failed to pass. However, the future of the new policies is unclear after immigrant rights advocates challenged them with lawsuits.\n\nApart from the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, the Italian hosts also invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Ms Meloni's migration and development initiatives.\n\nBut rights groups decried what they said was a lack of ambition in support for developing countries.\n\nThe ONE Campaign, which advocates for investment in Africa, said it had found the G7 and EU institutions' share of aid going to Africa was at its lowest point since 1973.\n\n\"Without any concrete action, the G7 in Italy amounts to no more than pointless platitudes,\" said David McNair, executive director at The ONE Campaign.\n\nAlthough the summit's final statement \"reflects promises of increased partnership between the G7 and Africa, there are very few specifics on what new financing, if any, will be available\".\n\nPope Francis also became the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, delivering a speech on artificial intelligence. Other invitees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe summit opened on Thursday with a strong show of support for Kyiv: an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion-dollar (£39.5 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denounced the freezing of Russian assets as \"theft\" and vowed it \"will not go unpunished\".\n\nMr Biden also signed a bilateral security agreement with Mr Zelensky, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv.\n\nBut some cracks appeared among the G7 leaders, notably Mr Macron deploring a lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final document.\n\nThe statement after last year's summit in Hiroshima, Japan, expressed a commitment to provide access to safe and legal abortion to women and girls, and pledged to defend gender equality and the rights of members of the LGBT+ community.\n\nThe word \"abortion\" was absent from this year's final communique, although it included a reference to promoting sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\n\"It was not possible to reach agreement on these things in the room,\" a senior EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the private discussions.\n\nAsked on Thursday about reports that abortion would not be included in the final text, Mr Macron said it was something he regretted.\n\nFrance \"has included women's right to abortion, the freedom of decision on one's own body, into its constitution\", he said, adding that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men\".\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" Mr Macron said.\n\nMs Meloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has denied she is rolling back rights to abortions, which have been legal in Italy since 1978. But the centre-left opposition has warned that her initiatives are chipping away at those rights, including by giving pro-life groups access to women considering abortions.",

        "summary": "The G7 summit in Italy concluded with leaders addressing key global issues such as migration, artificial intelligence, economic security, and financial support for Ukraine. The leaders emphasized their commitment to tackling these challenges collectively, highlighting solidarity with Ukraine, advocating for a ceasefire in Gaza, and investing in sustainable infrastructure in Africa. \n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her strict migration policies, pushed for increased investment in African nations to reduce migratory pressures on Europe. The G7 launched a coalition to combat migrant smuggling and address the root causes of irregular migration. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak supported Meloni's stance, emphasizing the need to prevent criminal gangs from controlling migration.\n\nThe summit also saw the participation of African leaders and other global figures, including Pope Francis, who spoke on artificial intelligence. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky secured a $50 billion loan backed by frozen Russian assets, a move condemned by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nHowever, the summit revealed divisions, particularly over the omission of abortion rights in the final declaration, a point lamented by French President Emmanuel Macron. Despite these differences, Macron described the summit as productive, with significant convergences on issues like Ukraine and the Middle East. Rights groups criticized the G7 for a lack of concrete support for developing countries, particularly in Africa.",

        "body": "The assistance will include food and drinking water, as well as malnutrition emergency screening and treatment for children.\n\nIt comes as estimates say that five million people inside Sudan suffer extreme hunger, with food lacking also in neighboring countries where two million Sudanese have fled.\n\n\"We need the world to wake up to the catastrophe happening before our very eyes,\" Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters.\n\n\"We've seen mortality projections estimating that in excess of 2.5 million people -- about 15 percent of the population -- in Darfur and Kordofan, the hardest-hit regions, could die by the end of September,\" she said.\n\n\"This is the largest humanitarian crisis on the face of the planet, and yet somehow it threatens to get worse,\" she said, pointing to expectations that the key border crossing will become unpassable with the rainy season.\n\nA UN humanitarian appeal for Sudan has received only 16 percent of its target, with much global attention focused instead on Gaza, where aid workers have also warned of famine risks.\n\nSamantha Power, the administrator of the US Agency for International Development (USAID), said Sudan could be in worse shape than Somalia in 2011 when some 250,000 people died after three consecutive seasons without enough rain in a country grappling with near anarchy.\n\n\"The most worrying scenario would be that Sudan would become the deadliest famine since Ethiopia in the early 1980s,\" when as many as 1.2 million people died, she said.\n\nSudan descended into war in April 2023 when the generals in charge of the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) took up arms to seize control, rejecting a plan to integrate.\n\nWith the two sides battling for power across the country, Power said that deliveries of aid across the rival sides' lines of control was \"virtually non-existent.\"\n\nPower strongly criticized both sides. The RSF, she said, has been \"systematically looting humanitarian warehouses, stealing food and livestock, destroying grain storage facilities and wells in the most vulnerable Sudanese communities.\"\n\nThe army, in turn \"completely contradicts its commitments and its responsibility\" to the Sudanese people by blocking aid from crossing the border with Chad into Darfur, she said.\n\n\"The really clear message here is that it is obstruction, not insufficient stocks of food, that is the driving force behind the historic and deadly levels of starvation in Sudan,\" she said.\n\nRepeated US-led efforts to end the conflict have failed, with many observers concluding that the warring generals each think they can win on the ground.\n\nA number of foreign powers have supported rival forces. Sudan expelled diplomats from the United Arab Emirates on allegations of fueling the RSF, while Egypt, Turkey and Iran have backed the army.\n\nRecent fighting in El-Fasher, the last city in Darfur outside RSF control, has killed more than 220 people, according to charity Doctors Without Borders.\n\nThe UN Security Council on Thursday demanded that the RSF halt the siege, with all countries voting in favor except Russia, which abstained.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken late last month called Sudan's army chief, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and pressed both for humanitarian access and a resumption of diplomacy between the two sides.\n\nTalks last year in the Saudi port city of Jeddah, brokered by the United States and Saudi Arabia, only briefly paused fighting, and a US push to restart the process has been unsuccessful.\n\n\"We know that there is no acceptable military solution to this conflict,\" Thomas-Greenfield said.",

It's not a place where you decide emergency measures or regulate things.\" He added that there were \"true convergences on Ukraine and Mideast\".\n\n\"It was a useful G7, with useful results,\" Mr Macron said. \"The coming weeks will create the conditions for political opportunities in particular around the two conflicts.\"\n\nMigration was the first topic of discussions on Friday, with the leaders mulling ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.\n\nThe issue is of particular interest to summit host Italy, which lies on one of the major routes into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her hardline stance on migration, has been eager to increase investment and funding for African nations as a means of reducing migratory pressure on Europe.\n\nJordan´s King Abdullah II, French President Emmanuel Macron and President of Algeria Abdelmadjid Tebboune (Christopher Furlong/Pool Photo via AP)\n\nThe leaders \"launched the G7 Coalition to prevent and counter the smuggling of migrants\", the summit's final declaration said, noting the seven nations would \"focus on the root causes of irregular migration, efforts to enhance border management and curb transnational organised crime, and safe and regular pathways for migration\".\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he and Ms Meloni - whom he described as \"fantastic\" - saw \"eye to eye\" on migration.\n\n\"We can't have criminal gangs decide who comes to our countries,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\nMs Meloni has a controversial five-year deal with neighbouring Albania for the Balkan country to host thousands of asylum seekers while Italy processes their claims. She has also spearheaded the \"Mattei Plan\" for Africa, a continent-wide strategy to increase economic opportunities at home and so discourage migration.\n\nFor its part, Britain has a deal to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, although no flights have yet taken off. Human rights organisations have criticised the agreement as unethical and unworkable.\n\nThe United States has also been struggling with a growing number of migrants. President Joe Biden introduced new policies to curb migration after a Bill he tried to get through Congress failed to pass. However, the future of the new policies is unclear after immigrant rights advocates challenged them with lawsuits.\n\nApart from the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, the Italian hosts also invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Ms Meloni's migration and development initiatives.\n\nG7 leaders and invitees pose for a group photo in Borgo Egnazia, near Bari in southern Italy at the end of the two-day summit (Andrew Medichini/AP)\n\nBut rights groups decried what they said was a lack of ambition in support for developing countries.\n\nThe ONE Campaign, which advocates for investment in Africa, said it had found the G7 and EU institutions' share of aid going to Africa was at its lowest point since 1973.\n\n\"Without any concrete action, the G7 in Italy amounts to no more than pointless platitudes,\" said David McNair, executive director at The ONE Campaign.\n\nAlthough the summit's final statement \"reflects promises of increased partnership between the G7 and Africa, there are very few specifics on what new financing, if any, will be available\".\n\nPope Francis also became the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, delivering a speech on artificial intelligence. Other invitees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe summit opened on Thursday with a strong show of support for Kyiv: an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion-dollar (£39.5 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denounced the freezing of Russian assets as \"theft\" and vowed it \"will not go unpunished\".\n\nMr Biden also signed a bilateral security agreement with Mr Zelensky, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv.\n\nBut some cracks appeared among the G7 leaders, notably Mr Macron deploring a lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final document.\n\nThe statement after last year's summit in Hiroshima, Japan, expressed a commitment to provide access to safe and legal abortion to women and girls, and pledged to defend gender equality and the rights of members of the LGBT+ community.\n\nThe word \"abortion\" was absent from this year's final communique, although it included a reference to promoting sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\n\"It was not possible to reach agreement on these things in the room,\" a senior EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the private discussions.\n\nAsked on Thursday about reports that abortion would not be included in the final text, Mr Macron said it was something he regretted.\n\nFrance \"has included women's right to abortion, the freedom of decision on one's own body, into its constitution\", he said, adding that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men\".\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" Mr Macron said.\n\nMs Meloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has denied she is rolling back rights to abortions, which have been legal in Italy since 1978. But the centre-left opposition has warned that her initiatives are chipping away at those rights, including by giving pro-life groups access to women considering abortions.",

        "body": "Witnesses reported strikes on the southern city of Rafah and central areas of the Gaza Strip.\n\nAt Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central city of Deir al-Balah, men gathered over the body of an 11-year-old boy who died during a bombardment of nearby Bureij refugee camp.\n\nIn a black singlet, the child lay on a floor smeared with fresh blood, a white bandage covering the top half of his face, AFP images showed.\n\nThe Israeli military said troops continued operations in central Gaza, where warplanes struck a militant cell in the Zeitun area.\n\nWitnesses in Rafah, on Gaza's southern border with Egypt, reported helicopter fire, while Hamas's armed wing said its militants fired mortar rounds at Israeli troops near the Tal al-Sultan neighbourhood.\n\nThe war began after Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages. Of these, 116 remain in Gaza, although the army says 41 are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,266 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-ruled territory's health ministry.\n\nThe toll includes at least 34 deaths over the past 24 hours, the ministry said on Friday.\n\nFears of a broader Middle East conflict have surged again, with Lebanon-based Hezbollah fighters, who are backed by Iran and allied with Hamas, launching waves of rockets, missiles and drones against Israeli military targets.\n\nHezbollah said intense strikes since Wednesday were retaliation for Israel's killing of one of its commanders.\n\nSirens sounded in northern Israel, where police said munitions had hit in the Kiryat Shmona area, with no reports of casualties.\n\nThe military said \"approximately 35 projectiles were identified crossing from Lebanon\". \"A number\" of them were intercepted while some caused fires.\n\nIsraeli forces responded with shelling, the military said, also announcing air strikes on \"Hezbollah terror infrastructure\" across the border.\n\nTwo women were killed in a strike on Jannata in southern Lebanon, village official Hassan Shur said, the latest deaths in near-daily exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and the Israeli military since the start of the Gaza war.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday that his country and the United States would work separately with Israeli and Lebanese authorities to ease tensions.\n\nDefence Minister Yoav Gallant rejected the initiative, decrying \"hostile policies against Israel\" by France, which last month had barred Israeli firms from an arms trade show.\n\nA spokesperson for the Israeli prime minister's office and senior foreign ministry officials however said Gallant's remarks do no reflect the government's position.\n\nDuring a Middle East trip this week to push a Gaza ceasefire plan, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said \"the best way\" to help resolve the Hezbollah-Israel violence was \"a resolution of the conflict in Gaza and getting a ceasefire\".\n\nAt a summit of G7 leaders in Italy, US President Joe Biden called Hamas \"the biggest hang-up so far\" to reaching a deal on a Gaza truce and hostage release.\n\nThe Palestinian group has insisted on the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and a permanent ceasefire, demands Israel has repeatedly rejected.\n\nBlinken has said Israel backs the latest plan, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose far-right coalition partners are strongly opposed, has not publicly endorsed it.\n\nBiden's roadmap for the first truce since a week-long pause and hostage-prisoner release in November includes a six-week ceasefire, hostage releases and Gaza's reconstruction.\n\nThe World Food Programme said that \"as fighting escalates in the south and centre of Gaza, the toll on civilians is devastating.\"\n\nBut \"with lawlessness inside the Strip... and active conflict\", it has become \"close to impossible to deliver the level of aid that meets the growing demands on the ground\", the UN agency's deputy executive director Carl Skau said.\n\n\"More than anything, people want this war to end,\" Skau added in a statement after a two-day visit to Gaza.\n\nThe World Health Organization has said more than 8,000 children under five have been treated for acute malnutrition in Gaza.\n\nAFP images from Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital showed the grieving family of a 10-year-old boy who died suffering from malnutrition. His limbs appeared thin and his ribcage was clearly visible.\n\nThe United States, Israel's close ally, imposed sanctions Friday on an Israeli group whose activists have blocked Gaza-bound aid convoys.\n\n\"Individuals from Tzav 9 have repeatedly sought to thwart the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza, including by blockading roads, sometimes violently,\" the US State Department said.\n\n\"They also have damaged aid trucks and dumped life-saving humanitarian aid onto the road.\"\n\nG7 leaders in a statement at the end of their summit urged the \"rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians in need\", and said the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, must be allowed to work unhindered in Gaza.\n\nIsrael had accused 12 of the agency's 13,000 Gaza staff of involvement in the October 7 attack, prompting a number of donor governments to temporarily suspend their contributions. An independent review said Israel did not support its claims with evidence.\n\nThe G7 statement also called for aid flow through \"all relevant land crossing points\" including the Rafah border, which has been shut since Israeli forces launched a ground operation in the city in early May.\n\nAs Muslims worldwide prepare to mark Eid al-Adha starting Sunday, Gazans lamented the shortages of essential goods.\n\n\"There is no Eid spirit,\" Mohammed Shabat, who like most of Gaza's population has been displaced by the war, said outside his tent in Deir al-Balah.",

        "title": "Biden Snapped at a Reporter and the WHCA Quickly Responded",
        "body": "President Biden promised to have the most transparent administration ever. That promise has not panned out.\n\nBiden is one of the least transparent presidents in modern times. It's likely because he isn't up to his job and he isn't really the person in charge. Those around him are making the decisions. He suffers from dementia so it is hard for him to communicate.\n\nThe president can't ad-lib well or answer questions off the cuff. He is easily confused and he loses his train of thought. None of this is going to stop with Biden. He can't control it and there is no cure for dementia. He is what we have.\n\nHe traveled to the G7 in Italy this week. The White House press corps went along, as they do. During these summits, there is usually a press conference or two that the American president does with the international press.\n\nThe focus at the G7 for Biden was Ukraine. He was pleased to boast about working with the other world leaders to work out a deal so that Ukraine secured loan money backed by the profits from frozen Russian investments. It was all worked out by Thursday. It is a 10-year agreement to continue providing military equipment to Ukraine.\n\nUkraine is not a G7 member but Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky was invited to attend the summit in Italy. He and Biden participated in a joint press conference on Thursday evening.\n\nEach man delivered prepared remarks.\n\n\"Would we stand with Ukraine?\" Biden said at the news conference. \"Would we stand for sovereignty, freedom, and against tyranny? The United States, the G7 and countries around the world have consistently answered that question by saying yes we will. We will say it again ... we're going to stand with Ukraine.\"\n\nThat's boilerplate stuff. We get it, Joe. We stand with Ukraine, come hell or high water. So, when it was time for the question and answer part of the news conference, Biden only wanted to talk about Ukraine.\n\nJoe Biden's staff prepares a list of reporters from which he is to call upon. That happens any time he does a press conference, rare as they are. It is reported that questions are screened in advance by his staff and they prepare answers for him. In this case, though, there did not seem to be pre-screened questions.\n\nThe first reporter called on by Biden was an AP reporter. That reporter went off track, though, and asked a question about Biden's son, Hunter, a convicted felon. Biden brushed that off by declaring that he's proud of his son for conquering his addiction problems. He said Hunter is the smartest and strongest man he knows, which is a common response from the Big Guy. Biden said he abides by the jury's decisions.\n\nBiden and Zelensky agreed to take four questions - two from the American press, two from the Ukrainian press.\n\nThe second reporter Biden called on was with Bloomberg. That reporter asked a question about Hamas and that is what set Biden off.\n\nWhen Bloomberg's Josh Wingrove got to ask his question, he shifted the topic to U.S. efforts in the Israel-Gaza war, which chaffed Biden.\n\n\"I wish you guys would play by the rules a little bit. I'm here to talk about a critical situation in Ukraine. You're asking another subject. I'll be happy to answer in detail later, but the bottom line is that we agreed [in regard to Gaza],\" Biden responded.\n\nExcuse me. Play by what rules? There are no rules in press conferences, or at least there aren't supposed to be any rules. We are supposed to have a free press in America. Journalists ask whatever questions they want to ask when they are called on.\n\nThe White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA) put out a strongly worded (for them) statement after Biden's outburst.\n\n\"The White House Correspondents' Association believes it is in the public interest to make clear that at a presidential press conference, at home or abroad, there are no preconditions regarding question topics,\" the statement read. \"While the White House does determine the number of reporters the president will recognize, it is up to professional journalists to decide what to ask.\"\n\nIt continued, \"Any leader may prefer that reporters ask only one question or ask only about a topic that is of most interest to the president or another world leader, but a free press functions independently. WHCA would welcome more opportunities to pose a range of questions to the president in a press conference setting.\"\n\nI wish we did have an independent press but we have seen time and time again that the American press is deeply in the tank for Democrats. They have chosen their side and stick with it.\n\nBiden is used to being protected from unwanted questions. He is sheltered from the press. This is why. He isn't able to handle a basic press conference with two questions from the American press.",

Biden, who struggles with off-the-cuff questions due to alleged cognitive issues, was frustrated by the deviation from the topic. The White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA) responded with a statement emphasizing that there should be no preconditions on question topics at press conferences, asserting the importance of a free press. This incident highlights ongoing concerns about Biden's transparency and ability to handle unscripted interactions with the media.",

        "title": "G7 leaders tackle migration, AI and economic security on final day of summit",
        "body": "The G7 leaders stressed their determination to meet global challenges \"at a crucial moment in history\".\n\nThe gathering in a luxury resort in Italy's southern Puglia region also discussed other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, the war in Gaza, climate change, Iran, the situation in the Red Sea, gender equality and China's industrial policy and economic security.\n\n\"We are working together and with others to address the pressing challenges of our time,\" the G7 leaders said in a final statement, noting their solidarity with Ukraine, support for a deal that would lead to an immediate ceasefire and release of hostages in Gaza, investment in sustainable infrastructure in Africa and commitments to address climate change and migration.\n\nDivisions did emerge during the summit, however, notably over the lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final declaration.\n\nAsked if the G7 gathering has lived up to expectations, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"The aim of the G7 is to create convergence and be able to remove misunderstandings. It's not a place where you decide emergency measures or regulate things.\" He added that there were \"true convergences on Ukraine and Mideast\".\n\n\"It was a useful G7, with useful results,\" Mr Macron said. \"The coming weeks will create the conditions for political opportunities in particular around the two conflicts.\"\n\nMigration was the first topic of discussions on Friday, with the leaders mulling ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.\n\nThe issue is of particular interest to summit host Italy, which lies on one of the major routes into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her hardline stance on migration, has been eager to increase investment and funding for African nations as a means of reducing migratory pressure on Europe.\n\nThe leaders \"launched the G7 Coalition to prevent and counter the smuggling of migrants\", the summit's final declaration said, noting the seven nations would \"focus on the root causes of irregular migration, efforts to enhance border management and curb transnational organised crime, and safe and regular pathways for migration\".\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he and Ms Meloni - whom he described as \"fantastic\" - saw \"eye to eye\" on migration.\n\n\"We can't have criminal gangs decide who comes to our countries,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\nMs Meloni has a controversial five-year deal with neighbouring Albania for the Balkan country to host thousands of asylum seekers while Italy processes their claims. She has also spearheaded the \"Mattei Plan\" for Africa, a continent-wide strategy to increase economic opportunities at home and so discourage migration.\n\nFor its part, Britain has a deal to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, although no flights have yet taken off. Human rights organisations have criticised the agreement as unethical and unworkable.\n\nThe United States has also been struggling with a growing number of migrants. President Joe Biden introduced new policies to curb migration after a Bill he tried to get through Congress failed to pass. However, the future of the new policies is unclear after immigrant rights advocates challenged them with lawsuits.\n\nApart from the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, the Italian hosts also invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Ms Meloni's migration and development initiatives.\n\nBut rights groups decried what they said was a lack of ambition in support for developing countries.\n\nThe ONE Campaign, which advocates for investment in Africa, said it had found the G7 and EU institutions' share of aid going to Africa was at its lowest point since 1973.\n\n\"Without any concrete action, the G7 in Italy amounts to no more than pointless platitudes,\" said David McNair, executive director at The ONE Campaign.\n\nAlthough the summit's final statement \"reflects promises of increased partnership between the G7 and Africa, there are very few specifics on what new financing, if any, will be available\".\n\nPope Francis also became the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, delivering a speech on artificial intelligence. Other invitees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe summit opened on Thursday with a strong show of support for Kyiv: an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion-dollar (£39.5 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denounced the freezing of Russian assets as \"theft\" and vowed it \"will not go unpunished\".\n\nMr Biden also signed a bilateral security agreement with Mr Zelensky, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv.\n\nBut some cracks appeared among the G7 leaders, notably Mr Macron deploring a lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final document.\n\nThe statement after last year's summit in Hiroshima, Japan, expressed a commitment to provide access to safe and legal abortion to women and girls, and pledged to defend gender equality and the rights of members of the LGBT+ community.\n\nThe word \"abortion\" was absent from this year's final communique, although it included a reference to promoting sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\n\"It was not possible to reach agreement on these things in the room,\" a senior EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the private discussions.\n\nAsked on Thursday about reports that abortion would not be included in the final text, Mr Macron said it was something he regretted.\n\nFrance \"has included women's right to abortion, the freedom of decision on one's own body, into its constitution\", he said, adding that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men\".\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" Mr Macron said.\n\nMs Meloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has denied she is rolling back rights to abortions, which have been legal in Italy since 1978. But the centre-left opposition has warned that her initiatives are chipping away at those rights, including by giving pro-life groups access to women considering abortions.",

        "body": "WASHINGTON (TND) -- Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. shared skepticism over a popular proposal to end the war in Gaza during an appearance on Piers Morgan Uncensored Thursday.\n\nCollege campuses across the U.S. were recently alight with protests and demonstrations calling for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war. However, Kennedy claimed a ceasefire will only create more fighting.\n\nIn their charter, Hamas has a provision that says it is against Islamic law to even negotiate with Israel except as a ruse,\" he said. \"I don't see how people who are saying 'you should have a ceasefire.' Then what? You've rewarded Hamas for taking hostages and they're going to keep taking hostages to get more and more advantage.\"\n\nHe continued by noting Hamas has already violated five ceasefire agreements, including the one in place on Oct. 7.\n\nKennedy also claimed Thursday Hamas must be destroyed for there to ever be peace in the region, asking \"I would say that hostages have to be returned and Hamas has to be disarmed, or else how can you have a peace?\"\n\nThe Biden administration has reportedly discussed initiating direct negotiations with Hamas to free American hostages as the war in Gaza continues. President Joe Biden recently said \"we're committed to getting the release of all the hostages, and we expect Hamas to release them all -- but if they don't, we'll do whatever it takes to get them all back home.\"\n\nREAD MORE | RFK Jr supports right to 'full term' abortions: 'We shouldn't have government involved'\n\nRFK Jr.'s stance comes as he is fighting to earn a spot on the debate stage alongside Biden and former President Donald Trump. His campaign in May filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, which accused CNN of excluding him from its debate.\n\n\"CNN is making prohibited corporate contributions to both campaigns and the Biden committee and the Trump committee have accepted these prohibited corporate contributions,\" Kennedy attorney Lorenzo Holloway argued in the letter.",

        "title": "G7 leaders tackle migration, AI and economic security on final day of summit",
        "body": "The G7 leaders stressed their determination to meet global challenges \"at a crucial moment in history\".\n\nThe gathering in a luxury resort in Italy's southern Puglia region also discussed other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, the war in Gaza, climate change, Iran, the situation in the Red Sea, gender equality and China's industrial policy and economic security.\n\n\"We are working together and with others to address the pressing challenges of our time,\" the G7 leaders said in a final statement, noting their solidarity with Ukraine, support for a deal that would lead to an immediate ceasefire and release of hostages in Gaza, investment in sustainable infrastructure in Africa and commitments to address climate change and migration.\n\nDivisions did emerge during the summit, however, notably over the lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final declaration.\n\nAsked if the G7 gathering has lived up to expectations, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"The aim of the G7 is to create convergence and be able to remove misunderstandings. It's not a place where you decide emergency measures or regulate things.\" He added that there were \"true convergences on Ukraine and Mideast\".\n\n\"It was a useful G7, with useful results,\" Mr Macron said. \"The coming weeks will create the conditions for political opportunities in particular around the two conflicts.\"\n\nMigration was the first topic of discussions on Friday, with the leaders mulling ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.\n\nThe issue is of particular interest to summit host Italy, which lies on one of the major routes into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her hardline stance on migration, has been eager to increase investment and funding for African nations as a means of reducing migratory pressure on Europe.\n\nThe leaders \"launched the G7 Coalition to prevent and counter the smuggling of migrants\", the summit's final declaration said, noting the seven nations would \"focus on the root causes of irregular migration, efforts to enhance border management and curb transnational organised crime, and safe and regular pathways for migration\".\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he and Ms Meloni - whom he described as \"fantastic\" - saw \"eye to eye\" on migration.\n\n\"We can't have criminal gangs decide who comes to our countries,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\nMs Meloni has a controversial five-year deal with neighbouring Albania for the Balkan country to host thousands of asylum seekers while Italy processes their claims. She has also spearheaded the \"Mattei Plan\" for Africa, a continent-wide strategy to increase economic opportunities at home and so discourage migration.\n\nFor its part, Britain has a deal to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, although no flights have yet taken off. Human rights organisations have criticised the agreement as unethical and unworkable.\n\nThe United States has also been struggling with a growing number of migrants. President Joe Biden introduced new policies to curb migration after a Bill he tried to get through Congress failed to pass. However, the future of the new policies is unclear after immigrant rights advocates challenged them with lawsuits.\n\nApart from the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, the Italian hosts also invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Ms Meloni's migration and development initiatives.\n\nBut rights groups decried what they said was a lack of ambition in support for developing countries.\n\nThe ONE Campaign, which advocates for investment in Africa, said it had found the G7 and EU institutions' share of aid going to Africa was at its lowest point since 1973.\n\n\"Without any concrete action, the G7 in Italy amounts to no more than pointless platitudes,\" said David McNair, executive director at The ONE Campaign.\n\nAlthough the summit's final statement \"reflects promises of increased partnership between the G7 and Africa, there are very few specifics on what new financing, if any, will be available\".\n\nPope Francis also became the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, delivering a speech on artificial intelligence. Other invitees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe summit opened on Thursday with a strong show of support for Kyiv: an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion-dollar (£39.5 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denounced the freezing of Russian assets as \"theft\" and vowed it \"will not go unpunished\".\n\nMr Biden also signed a bilateral security agreement with Mr Zelensky, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv.\n\nBut some cracks appeared among the G7 leaders, notably Mr Macron deploring a lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final document.\n\nThe statement after last year's summit in Hiroshima, Japan, expressed a commitment to provide access to safe and legal abortion to women and girls, and pledged to defend gender equality and the rights of members of the LGBT+ community.\n\nThe word \"abortion\" was absent from this year's final communique, although it included a reference to promoting sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\n\"It was not possible to reach agreement on these things in the room,\" a senior EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the private discussions.\n\nAsked on Thursday about reports that abortion would not be included in the final text, Mr Macron said it was something he regretted.\n\nFrance \"has included women's right to abortion, the freedom of decision on one's own body, into its constitution\", he said, adding that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men\".\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" Mr Macron said.\n\nMs Meloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has denied she is rolling back rights to abortions, which have been legal in Italy since 1978. But the centre-left opposition has warned that her initiatives are chipping away at those rights, including by giving pro-life groups access to women considering abortions.",

The leaders emphasized solidarity with Ukraine, support for a Gaza ceasefire, investment in African infrastructure, and commitments to climate change and migration. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her strict migration policies, pushed for increased investment in Africa to reduce migratory pressures. The G7 launched a coalition to combat migrant smuggling and discussed border management and safe migration pathways. \n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron noted the summit's focus on creating convergence rather than emergency measures, highlighting agreements on Ukraine and the Middle East.

President Joe Biden introduced new policies to curb migration after a Bill he tried to get through Congress failed to pass. However, the future of the new policies is unclear after immigrant rights advocates challenged them with lawsuits.\n\nApart from the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, the Italian hosts also invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Ms Meloni's migration and development initiatives.\n\nBut rights groups decried what they said was a lack of ambition in support for developing countries.\n\nThe ONE Campaign, which advocates for investment in Africa, said it had found the G7 and EU institutions' share of aid going to Africa was at its lowest point since 1973.\n\n\"Without any concrete action, the G7 in Italy amounts to no more than pointless platitudes,\" said David McNair, executive director at The ONE Campaign.\n\nAlthough the summit's final statement \"reflects promises of increased partnership between the G7 and Africa, there are very few specifics on what new financing, if any, will be available\".\n\nPope Francis also became the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, delivering a speech on artificial intelligence. Other invitees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe summit opened on Thursday with a strong show of support for Kyiv: an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion-dollar (£39.5 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denounced the freezing of Russian assets as \"theft\" and vowed it \"will not go unpunished\".\n\nMr Biden also signed a bilateral security agreement with Mr Zelensky, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv.\n\nBut some cracks appeared among the G7 leaders, notably Mr Macron deploring a lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final document.\n\nThe statement after last year's summit in Hiroshima, Japan, expressed a commitment to provide access to safe and legal abortion to women and girls, and pledged to defend gender equality and the rights of members of the LGBT+ community.\n\nThe word \"abortion\" was absent from this year's final communique, although it included a reference to promoting sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\n\"It was not possible to reach agreement on these things in the room,\" a senior EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the private discussions.\n\nAsked on Thursday about reports that abortion would not be included in the final text, Mr Macron said it was something he regretted.\n\nFrance \"has included women's right to abortion, the freedom of decision on one's own body, into its constitution\", he said, adding that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men\".\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" Mr Macron said.\n\nMs Meloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has denied she is rolling back rights to abortions, which have been legal in Italy since 1978. But the centre-left opposition has warned that her initiatives are chipping away at those rights, including by giving pro-life groups access to women considering abortions.",

        "summary": "The G7 summit in Italy concluded with leaders addressing key global issues such as migration, artificial intelligence, economic security, and financial support for Ukraine. The leaders emphasized their solidarity with Ukraine, support for a ceasefire in Gaza, investment in sustainable infrastructure in Africa, and commitments to climate change and migration. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her strict migration policies, pushed for increased investment in African nations to reduce migratory pressure on Europe. The G7 launched a coalition to combat migrant smuggling and discussed enhancing border management.\n\nDivisions emerged over the absence of a reference to abortion in the final declaration, a point lamented by French President Emmanuel Macron. The summit also saw the first address by Pope Francis on artificial intelligence and included discussions with leaders from Ukraine, Brazil, India, and Turkey. The G7 agreed on a $50 billion loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets, which Russian President Vladimir Putin condemned. Despite some disagreements, Macron described the summit as useful, with significant convergences on Ukraine and the Middle East. Rights groups criticized the G7 for a lack of concrete support for developing countries, particularly in Africa.",

        "body": "The G7 leaders stressed their determination to meet global challenges \"at a crucial moment in history\".\n\nThe gathering in a luxury resort in Italy's southern Puglia region also discussed other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, the war in Gaza, climate change, Iran, the situation in the Red Sea, gender equality and China's industrial policy and economic security.\n\n\"We are working together and with others to address the pressing challenges of our time,\" the G7 leaders said in a final statement, noting their solidarity with Ukraine, support for a deal that would lead to an immediate ceasefire and release of hostages in Gaza, investment in sustainable infrastructure in Africa and commitments to address climate change and migration.\n\nDivisions did emerge during the summit, however, notably over the lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final declaration.\n\nAsked if the G7 gathering has lived up to expectations, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"The aim of the G7 is to create convergence and be able to remove misunderstandings. It's not a place where you decide emergency measures or regulate things.\" He added that there were \"true convergences on Ukraine and Mideast\".\n\n\"It was a useful G7, with useful results,\" Mr Macron said. \"The coming weeks will create the conditions for political opportunities in particular around the two conflicts.\"\n\nMigration was the first topic of discussions on Friday, with the leaders mulling ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.\n\nThe issue is of particular interest to summit host Italy, which lies on one of the major routes into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her hardline stance on migration, has been eager to increase investment and funding for African nations as a means of reducing migratory pressure on Europe.\n\nThe leaders \"launched the G7 Coalition to prevent and counter the smuggling of migrants\", the summit's final declaration said, noting the seven nations would \"focus on the root causes of irregular migration, efforts to enhance border management and curb transnational organised crime, and safe and regular pathways for migration\".\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he and Ms Meloni - whom he described as \"fantastic\" - saw \"eye to eye\" on migration.\n\n\"We can't have criminal gangs decide who comes to our countries,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\nMs Meloni has a controversial five-year deal with neighbouring Albania for the Balkan country to host thousands of asylum seekers while Italy processes their claims. She has also spearheaded the \"Mattei Plan\" for Africa, a continent-wide strategy to increase economic opportunities at home and so discourage migration.\n\nFor its part, Britain has a deal to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, although no flights have yet taken off. Human rights organisations have criticised the agreement as unethical and unworkable.\n\nThe United States has also been struggling with a growing number of migrants. President Joe Biden introduced new policies to curb migration after a Bill he tried to get through Congress failed to pass. However, the future of the new policies is unclear after immigrant rights advocates challenged them with lawsuits.\n\nApart from the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, the Italian hosts also invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Ms Meloni's migration and development initiatives.\n\nBut rights groups decried what they said was a lack of ambition in support for developing countries.\n\nThe ONE Campaign, which advocates for investment in Africa, said it had found the G7 and EU institutions' share of aid going to Africa was at its lowest point since 1973.\n\n\"Without any concrete action, the G7 in Italy amounts to no more than pointless platitudes,\" said David McNair, executive director at The ONE Campaign.\n\nAlthough the summit's final statement \"reflects promises of increased partnership between the G7 and Africa, there are very few specifics on what new financing, if any, will be available\".\n\nPope Francis also became the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, delivering a speech on artificial intelligence.

        "title": "G7 leaders tackle migration, AI and economic security on final day of summit",
        "body": "The G7 leaders stressed their determination to meet global challenges \"at a crucial moment in history\".\n\nThe gathering in a luxury resort in Italy's southern Puglia region also discussed other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, the war in Gaza, climate change, Iran, the situation in the Red Sea, gender equality and China's industrial policy and economic security.\n\n\"We are working together and with others to address the pressing challenges of our time,\" the G7 leaders said in a final statement, noting their solidarity with Ukraine, support for a deal that would lead to an immediate ceasefire and release of hostages in Gaza, investment in sustainable infrastructure in Africa and commitments to address climate change and migration.\n\nDivisions did emerge during the summit, however, notably over the lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final declaration.\n\nAsked if the G7 gathering has lived up to expectations, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"The aim of the G7 is to create convergence and be able to remove misunderstandings. It's not a place where you decide emergency measures or regulate things.\" He added that there were \"true convergences on Ukraine and Mideast\".\n\n\"It was a useful G7, with useful results,\" Mr Macron said. \"The coming weeks will create the conditions for political opportunities in particular around the two conflicts.\"\n\nMigration was the first topic of discussions on Friday, with the leaders mulling ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.\n\nThe issue is of particular interest to summit host Italy, which lies on one of the major routes into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her hardline stance on migration, has been eager to increase investment and funding for African nations as a means of reducing migratory pressure on Europe.\n\nThe leaders \"launched the G7 Coalition to prevent and counter the smuggling of migrants\", the summit's final declaration said, noting the seven nations would \"focus on the root causes of irregular migration, efforts to enhance border management and curb transnational organised crime, and safe and regular pathways for migration\".\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he and Ms Meloni - whom he described as \"fantastic\" - saw \"eye to eye\" on migration.\n\n\"We can't have criminal gangs decide who comes to our countries,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\nMs Meloni has a controversial five-year deal with neighbouring Albania for the Balkan country to host thousands of asylum seekers while Italy processes their claims. She has also spearheaded the \"Mattei Plan\" for Africa, a continent-wide strategy to increase economic opportunities at home and so discourage migration.\n\nFor its part, Britain has a deal to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, although no flights have yet taken off. Human rights organisations have criticised the agreement as unethical and unworkable.\n\nThe United States has also been struggling with a growing number of migrants. President Joe Biden introduced new policies to curb migration after a Bill he tried to get through Congress failed to pass. However, the future of the new policies is unclear after immigrant rights advocates challenged them with lawsuits.\n\nApart from the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, the Italian hosts also invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Ms Meloni's migration and development initiatives.\n\nBut rights groups decried what they said was a lack of ambition in support for developing countries.\n\nThe ONE Campaign, which advocates for investment in Africa, said it had found the G7 and EU institutions' share of aid going to Africa was at its lowest point since 1973.\n\n\"Without any concrete action, the G7 in Italy amounts to no more than pointless platitudes,\" said David McNair, executive director at The ONE Campaign.\n\nAlthough the summit's final statement \"reflects promises of increased partnership between the G7 and Africa, there are very few specifics on what new financing, if any, will be available\".\n\nPope Francis also became the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, delivering a speech on artificial intelligence. Other invitees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe summit opened on Thursday with a strong show of support for Kyiv: an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion-dollar (£39.5 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denounced the freezing of Russian assets as \"theft\" and vowed it \"will not go unpunished\".\n\nMr Biden also signed a bilateral security agreement with Mr Zelensky, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv.\n\nBut some cracks appeared among the G7 leaders, notably Mr Macron deploring a lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final document.\n\nThe statement after last year's summit in Hiroshima, Japan, expressed a commitment to provide access to safe and legal abortion to women and girls, and pledged to defend gender equality and the rights of members of the LGBT+ community.\n\nThe word \"abortion\" was absent from this year's final communique, although it included a reference to promoting sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\n\"It was not possible to reach agreement on these things in the room,\" a senior EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the private discussions.\n\nAsked on Thursday about reports that abortion would not be included in the final text, Mr Macron said it was something he regretted.\n\nFrance \"has included women's right to abortion, the freedom of decision on one's own body, into its constitution\", he said, adding that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men\".\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" Mr Macron said.\n\nMs Meloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has denied she is rolling back rights to abortions, which have been legal in Italy since 1978. But the centre-left opposition has warned that her initiatives are chipping away at those rights, including by giving pro-life groups access to women considering abortions.",

        "body": "Mina (Saudi Arabia): In sweltering temperatures, Muslim pilgrims in Mecca converged on a vast tent camp in the desert on Friday, officially opening the annual Hajj pilgrimage. Ahead of their trip, they circled the cube-shaped Kaaba in the Grand Mosque, Islam's holiest site.\n\nMore than 1.5 million pilgrims from around the world have already amassed in and around Mecca for the Hajj, and the number was still growing as more pilgrims from inside Saudi Arabia joined. Saudi authorities expected the number of pilgrims to exceed 2 million this year.\n\nThis year's Hajj came against the backdrop of the raging war in the Gaza Strip between Israel and Palestinian militants, which pushed the entire Middle East to the brink of a regional war between Israel and its allies on one side and Iran-backed militant groups on the other.\n\nPalestinians in the coastal enclave of Gaza were not able to travel to Mecca for Hajj this year because of the closure of the Rafah crossing in May when Israel extended its ground offensive to the strip's southern city of Rafah on the border with Egypt.\n\nPalestinian authorities said 4,200 pilgrims from the occupied West Bank arrived in Mecca for Hajj. Saudi authorities said 1,000 more from the families of Palestinians killed or wounded in the war in Gaza also arrived to perform Hajj at the invitation of King Salman of Saudi Arabia. The 1,000 invitees were already outside Gaza -- mostly in Egypt -- before closure of the Rafah crossing.\n\n\"We are deprived of (performing) Hajj because the crossing is closed, and because of the raging wars and destruction,\" said Amna Abu Mutlaq, a 75-year-old Palestinian woman from Gaza's southern city of Khan Younis who had planned to perform Hajj this year. \"They (Israel) deprived us from everything.\"\n\nThis year's Hajj also saw Syrian pilgrims travelling to Mecca on direct flights from Damascus for the first time in more than a decade. The move was part of an ongoing thaw in relations between Saudi Arabia and conflict-stricken Syria. Syrians in rebel-held areas used to cross the border into neighbuoring Turkiye in their exhausting trip to Mecca for Hajj.\n\n\"This is the natural thing: Pilgrims go to Hajj directly from their home countries,\" said Abdel-Aziz al-Ashqar, a Syrian coordinator of the group of pilgrims who left Damascus this year for Hajj.\n\nThe pilgrimage is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, and all Muslims are required to make the five-day Hajj at least once in their lives if they are physically and financially able to do it.\n\nIt is a moving spiritual experience for pilgrims who believe it absolves sins and brings them closer to God, while uniting the world's more than 2 billion Muslims. It's also a chance to pray for peace in many conflict-stricken Arab and Muslim countries, including Yemen and Sudan, where more than a year of war between rival generals created the world's largest displacement crisis.\n\nFor many Muslims, the Hajj is the only major journey that they made in their life. Some spend years saving up money and waiting for a permit to embark on the journey in their 50s and 60s after they raise their children.\n\nThe rituals during the Hajj largely commemorate the Quran's accounts of Prophet Ibrahim (pbuh), his son Prophet Ismail (pbuh) and Ismail's mother Hajar -- or Abraham and Ismael as they are named in the Bible.\n\nMale pilgrims wear an ihram, two unstitched sheets of white cloth that resemble a shroud, while women dress conservative, loose-fitting clothing with headscarves, and forgo makeup and perfume. They have been doing the ritual circuit around the cube-shaped Kaaba, counter-clockwise in the seven-minaret Grand Mosque since arriving in Mecca over recent days.\n\nSaudi authorities have adopted security restrictions in and around Mecca, with checkpoints set up on roads leading to the city to prevent those who don't have Hajj permits from reaching the holy sites.\n\nSecurity authorities arrested many people who attempted to take pilgrims to Mecca who didn't have Hajj permits, said Lt. Gen. Muhammad al-Bassami, head of Hajj Security Committee. Most of them were expelled from the country, while travel agents face jail for up to six months, according to the Interior Ministry.\n\nOn Friday, the pilgrims made their way to Mina, officially opening the Hajj. They then will move for a daylong vigil Saturday on Mount Arafat, a desert hill where the Prophet Muhammad is said to have delivered his final speech, known as the Farewell Sermon. Healthy pilgrims make the trip on foot, others use buses or trains.\n\nThe time of year when the Hajj takes place varies, given that Hajj is set for five days in the second week of Dhu al-Hijjah, the last month in the Islamic lunar calendar.\n\nMost of the Hajj rituals are held outdoors with little if any shade. When it falls in the summer months, temperatures can soar to over 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). The Health Ministry has cautioned that temperatures in the holy sites could reach 48 Celsius (118 Fahrenheit). Many pilgrims carried umbrellas against the burning sun.\n\nAfter Saturday's warship in Arafat, pilgrims will travel a few kilometers (miles) to a site known as Muzdalifa to collect pebbles that they will use in the symbolic stoning of pillars representing the devil back in Mina.\n\nPilgrims then return to Mina for three days, coinciding with the festive Eid al-Azha holiday, when financially able Muslims around the world slaughter livestock and distribute the meat to the poor. Afterwards, they return to Mecca for final circumambulation, known as Farewell Tawaf.\n\nIn recent years, the annual pilgrimage has returned to its monumental scale after three years of heavy restrictions because of the coronavirus pandemic. Last year, more than 1.8 million pilgrims performed Hajj, approaching the 2019 level when more than 2.4 million pilgrims participated in the pilgrimage.",

        "title": "G7 leaders tackle migration, AI and economic security on final day of summit",
        "body": "The G7 leaders stressed their determination to meet global challenges \"at a crucial moment in history\".\n\nThe gathering in a luxury resort in Italy's southern Puglia region also discussed other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, the war in Gaza, climate change, Iran, the situation in the Red Sea, gender equality and China's industrial policy and economic security.\n\n\"We are working together and with others to address the pressing challenges of our time,\" the G7 leaders said in a final statement, noting their solidarity with Ukraine, support for a deal that would lead to an immediate ceasefire and release of hostages in Gaza, investment in sustainable infrastructure in Africa and commitments to address climate change and migration.\n\nDivisions did emerge during the summit, however, notably over the lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final declaration.\n\nAsked if the G7 gathering has lived up to expectations, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"The aim of the G7 is to create convergence and be able to remove misunderstandings. It's not a place where you decide emergency measures or regulate things.\" He added that there were \"true convergences on Ukraine and Mideast\".\n\n\"It was a useful G7, with useful results,\" Mr Macron said. \"The coming weeks will create the conditions for political opportunities in particular around the two conflicts.\"\n\nMigration was the first topic of discussions on Friday, with the leaders mulling ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.\n\nThe issue is of particular interest to summit host Italy, which lies on one of the major routes into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her hardline stance on migration, has been eager to increase investment and funding for African nations as a means of reducing migratory pressure on Europe.\n\nThe leaders \"launched the G7 Coalition to prevent and counter the smuggling of migrants\", the summit's final declaration said, noting the seven nations would \"focus on the root causes of irregular migration, efforts to enhance border management and curb transnational organised crime, and safe and regular pathways for migration\".\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he and Ms Meloni - whom he described as \"fantastic\" - saw \"eye to eye\" on migration.\n\n\"We can't have criminal gangs decide who comes to our countries,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\nMs Meloni has a controversial five-year deal with neighbouring Albania for the Balkan country to host thousands of asylum seekers while Italy processes their claims. She has also spearheaded the \"Mattei Plan\" for Africa, a continent-wide strategy to increase economic opportunities at home and so discourage migration.\n\nFor its part, Britain has a deal to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, although no flights have yet taken off. Human rights organisations have criticised the agreement as unethical and unworkable.\n\nThe United States has also been struggling with a growing number of migrants. President Joe Biden introduced new policies to curb migration after a Bill he tried to get through Congress failed to pass. However, the future of the new policies is unclear after immigrant rights advocates challenged them with lawsuits.\n\nApart from the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, the Italian hosts also invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Ms Meloni's migration and development initiatives.\n\nBut rights groups decried what they said was a lack of ambition in support for developing countries.\n\nThe ONE Campaign, which advocates for investment in Africa, said it had found the G7 and EU institutions' share of aid going to Africa was at its lowest point since 1973.\n\n\"Without any concrete action, the G7 in Italy amounts to no more than pointless platitudes,\" said David McNair, executive director at The ONE Campaign.\n\nAlthough the summit's final statement \"reflects promises of increased partnership between the G7 and Africa, there are very few specifics on what new financing, if any, will be available\".\n\nPope Francis also became the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, delivering a speech on artificial intelligence. Other invitees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe summit opened on Thursday with a strong show of support for Kyiv: an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion-dollar (£39.5 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denounced the freezing of Russian assets as \"theft\" and vowed it \"will not go unpunished\".\n\nMr Biden also signed a bilateral security agreement with Mr Zelensky, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv.\n\nBut some cracks appeared among the G7 leaders, notably Mr Macron deploring a lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final document.\n\nThe statement after last year's summit in Hiroshima, Japan, expressed a commitment to provide access to safe and legal abortion to women and girls, and pledged to defend gender equality and the rights of members of the LGBT+ community.\n\nThe word \"abortion\" was absent from this year's final communique, although it included a reference to promoting sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\n\"It was not possible to reach agreement on these things in the room,\" a senior EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the private discussions.\n\nAsked on Thursday about reports that abortion would not be included in the final text, Mr Macron said it was something he regretted.\n\nFrance \"has included women's right to abortion, the freedom of decision on one's own body, into its constitution\", he said, adding that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men\".\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" Mr Macron said.\n\nMs Meloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has denied she is rolling back rights to abortions, which have been legal in Italy since 1978. But the centre-left opposition has warned that her initiatives are chipping away at those rights, including by giving pro-life groups access to women considering abortions.",

        "body": "The leaders stressed their determination to meet global challenges 'at a crucial moment in history'.\n\nThe Group of Seven leading industrialised nations turned their attention to migration, artificial intelligence, economic security and the Indo-Pacific region on Friday, the second and final day of their summit in Italy.\n\nThe G7 leaders stressed their determination to meet global challenges \"at a crucial moment in history\".\n\nThe gathering in a luxury resort in Italy's southern Puglia region also discussed other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, the war in Gaza, climate change, Iran, the situation in the Red Sea, gender equality and China's industrial policy and economic security.\n\n\"We are working together and with others to address the pressing challenges of our time,\" the G7 leaders said in a final statement, noting their solidarity with Ukraine, support for a deal that would lead to an immediate ceasefire and release of hostages in Gaza, investment in sustainable infrastructure in Africa and commitments to address climate change and migration.\n\nAsked if the G7 gathering has lived up to expectations, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"The aim of the G7 is to create convergence and be able to remove misunderstandings. It's not a place where you decide emergency measures or regulate things.\" He added that there were \"true convergences on Ukraine and Mideast\".\n\n\"It was a useful G7, with useful results,\" Mr Macron said. \"The coming weeks will create the conditions for political opportunities in particular around the two conflicts.\"\n\nMigration was the first topic of discussions on Friday, with the leaders mulling ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.\n\nThe issue is of particular interest to summit host Italy, which lies on one of the major routes into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her hardline stance on migration, has been eager to increase investment and funding for African nations as a means of reducing migratory pressure on Europe.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he and Ms Meloni - whom he described as \"fantastic\" - saw \"eye to eye\" on migration.\n\n\"We can't have criminal gangs decide who comes to our countries,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\nMs Meloni has a controversial five-year deal with neighbouring Albania for the Balkan country to host thousands of asylum seekers while Italy processes their claims. She has also spearheaded the \"Mattei Plan\" for Africa, a continent-wide strategy to increase economic opportunities at home and so discourage migration.\n\nFor its part, Britain has a deal to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, although no flights have yet taken off. Human rights organisations have criticised the agreement as unethical and unworkable.\n\nThe United States has also been struggling with a growing number of migrants. President Joe Biden introduced new policies to curb migration after a Bill he tried to get through Congress failed to pass. However, the future of the new policies is unclear after immigrant rights advocates challenged them with lawsuits.\n\nApart from the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, the Italian hosts also invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Ms Meloni's migration and development initiatives.\n\nThe ONE Campaign, which advocates for investment in Africa, said it had found the G7 and EU institutions' share of aid going to Africa was at its lowest point since 1973.\n\n\"Without any concrete action, the G7 in Italy amounts to no more than pointless platitudes,\" said David McNair, executive director at The ONE Campaign.\n\nAlthough the summit's final statement \"reflects promises of increased partnership between the G7 and Africa, there are very few specifics on what new financing, if any, will be available\".\n\nPope Francis also became the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, delivering a speech on artificial intelligence. Other invitees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe summit opened on Thursday with a strong show of support for Kyiv: an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion-dollar (£39.5 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denounced the freezing of Russian assets as \"theft\" and vowed it \"will not go unpunished\".\n\nMr Biden also signed a bilateral security agreement with Mr Zelensky, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv.\n\nBut some cracks appeared among the G7 leaders, notably Mr Macron deploring a lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final document.\n\nThe statement after last year's summit in Hiroshima, Japan, expressed a commitment to provide access to safe and legal abortion to women and girls, and pledged to defend gender equality and the rights of members of the LGBT+ community.\n\nThe word \"abortion\" was absent from this year's final communique, although it included a reference to promoting sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\n\"It was not possible to reach agreement on these things in the room,\" a senior EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the private discussions.\n\nAsked on Thursday about reports that abortion would not be included in the final text, Mr Macron said it was something he regretted.\n\nFrance \"has included women's right to abortion, the freedom of decision on one's own body, into its constitution\", he said, adding that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men\".\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" Mr Macron said.\n\nMs Meloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has denied she is rolling back rights to abortions, which have been legal in Italy since 1978. But the centre-left opposition has warned that her initiatives are chipping away at those rights, including by giving pro-life groups access to women considering abortions.",

        "title": "McConnell explores his next chapter post leadership retirement - Washington Examiner",
        "body": "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) is considering his next move after he plans to step down as the longest-serving Senate leader in November, according to sources familiar with his thinking.\n\nIf Republicans win the Senate majority in November, there will be a new batch of faces at the helm of every committee and seniority is heavily considered when the assignments are made. Senate Republicans determine their committee assignments by having each senator submit requests and rank their preferences. Seniority as well as those rankings are factored into the final decisions.\n\nAxios reported on Friday that the 82-year-old Kentucky senator is interested in becoming the next chairman of the Appropriations Committee, one of the most high-profile and influential committee assignments. However, McConnell's office is pushing back on that assessment.\n\n\"Leader McConnell is focused on finishing the 118th Congress strong and helping Senate Republicans regain the majority,\" said Doug Andres, a spokesman for the senator, in a statement provided to the Washington Examiner.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-ME) is currently the vice chairwoman of the panel. Her staff appeared to downplay the idea that McConnell could decide to leapfrog ahead of her to take the top spot on the committee.\n\n\"Senator Collins fully anticipates that in the next Congress, she will either be the chair or vice chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee,\" Annie Clark, communications director for Collins, told the Washington Examiner in a statement. \"Of course, it is Senator McConnell's prerogative to make his own decisions given his seniority.\"\n\nIn a normal scenario, if Republicans regain the majority, Collins would become the full chair of the committee and the defense subcommittee chair. However, there could be a situation in which Collins becomes the full chair and McConnell could lead the defense subcommittee. Both Collins and McConnell are close allies who have similar views on appropriations funding and the military.\n\nIn addition to serving on the Appropriations Committee, McConnell also serves on the Agriculture, Rules, and the Select Committee on Intelligence. Several sources close with the Republican leader emphasize he has not made a decision about which posts he's looking to pursue in the future. However, they did not dispute the fact he could be interested in the high-ranking post on the committee that is responsible for funding the federal government's vital activities.\n\nMcConnell has been instrumental as the central Republican figure on Capitol Hill to pass $95 billion in foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel, Gaza, and the Indo-Pacific despite fierce resistance from some Republicans.\n\nMcConnell has staked his legacy on standing with Ukraine as it fends off a Russian invasion for the last two years. Beginning this fall, nearly every day during the Senate session, he delivered a speech in support of providing military resources to Ukraine, pushing back against what he has called the \"misguided fantasies\" of the \"America First\" movement.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nA perch atop the Appropriations Committee could give the Kentucky Republican even more sway over military funding and spending. The position could ultimately put him at odds with former President Donald Trump if he wins the presidency.\n\n\"I think it's fair to say he's considering the road ahead, but it's too early to say where that road may lead,\" a source familiar with McConnell's thinking said.",

        "summary": "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) is contemplating his future after planning to step down as the longest-serving Senate leader in November. If Republicans win the Senate majority, McConnell is reportedly interested in chairing the influential Appropriations Committee, though his office has not confirmed this. Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), currently the vice chairwoman, expects to lead the committee if Republicans regain control. McConnell, a key figure in passing significant foreign aid and a staunch supporter of Ukraine, has not finalized his future committee roles. His potential leadership in the Appropriations Committee could enhance his influence over military funding, possibly conflicting with former President Donald Trump if he returns to office.",

        "title": "G7 leaders tackle migration, AI and economic security on final day of summit",
        "body": "The G7 leaders stressed their determination to meet global challenges \"at a crucial moment in history\".\n\nThe gathering in a luxury resort in Italy's southern Puglia region also discussed other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, the war in Gaza, climate change, Iran, the situation in the Red Sea, gender equality and China's industrial policy and economic security.\n\n\"We are working together and with others to address the pressing challenges of our time,\" the G7 leaders said in a final statement, noting their solidarity with Ukraine, support for a deal that would lead to an immediate ceasefire and release of hostages in Gaza, investment in sustainable infrastructure in Africa and commitments to address climate change and migration.\n\nDivisions did emerge during the summit, however, notably over the lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final declaration.\n\nAsked if the G7 gathering has lived up to expectations, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"The aim of the G7 is to create convergence and be able to remove misunderstandings. It's not a place where you decide emergency measures or regulate things.\" He added that there were \"true convergences on Ukraine and Mideast\".\n\n\"It was a useful G7, with useful results,\" Mr Macron said. \"The coming weeks will create the conditions for political opportunities in particular around the two conflicts.\"\n\nMigration was the first topic of discussions on Friday, with the leaders mulling ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.\n\nThe issue is of particular interest to summit host Italy, which lies on one of the major routes into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her hardline stance on migration, has been eager to increase investment and funding for African nations as a means of reducing migratory pressure on Europe.\n\nThe leaders \"launched the G7 Coalition to prevent and counter the smuggling of migrants\", the summit's final declaration said, noting the seven nations would \"focus on the root causes of irregular migration, efforts to enhance border management and curb transnational organised crime, and safe and regular pathways for migration\".\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he and Ms Meloni - whom he described as \"fantastic\" - saw \"eye to eye\" on migration.\n\n\"We can't have criminal gangs decide who comes to our countries,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\nMs Meloni has a controversial five-year deal with neighbouring Albania for the Balkan country to host thousands of asylum seekers while Italy processes their claims. She has also spearheaded the \"Mattei Plan\" for Africa, a continent-wide strategy to increase economic opportunities at home and so discourage migration.\n\nFor its part, Britain has a deal to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, although no flights have yet taken off. Human rights organisations have criticised the agreement as unethical and unworkable.\n\nThe United States has also been struggling with a growing number of migrants. President Joe Biden introduced new policies to curb migration after a Bill he tried to get through Congress failed to pass. However, the future of the new policies is unclear after immigrant rights advocates challenged them with lawsuits.\n\nApart from the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, the Italian hosts also invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Ms Meloni's migration and development initiatives.\n\nBut rights groups decried what they said was a lack of ambition in support for developing countries.\n\nThe ONE Campaign, which advocates for investment in Africa, said it had found the G7 and EU institutions' share of aid going to Africa was at its lowest point since 1973.\n\n\"Without any concrete action, the G7 in Italy amounts to no more than pointless platitudes,\" said David McNair, executive director at The ONE Campaign.\n\nAlthough the summit's final statement \"reflects promises of increased partnership between the G7 and Africa, there are very few specifics on what new financing, if any, will be available\".\n\nPope Francis also became the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, delivering a speech on artificial intelligence. Other invitees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe summit opened on Thursday with a strong show of support for Kyiv: an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion-dollar (£39.5 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denounced the freezing of Russian assets as \"theft\" and vowed it \"will not go unpunished\".\n\nMr Biden also signed a bilateral security agreement with Mr Zelensky, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv.\n\nBut some cracks appeared among the G7 leaders, notably Mr Macron deploring a lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final document.\n\nThe statement after last year's summit in Hiroshima, Japan, expressed a commitment to provide access to safe and legal abortion to women and girls, and pledged to defend gender equality and the rights of members of the LGBT+ community.\n\nThe word \"abortion\" was absent from this year's final communique, although it included a reference to promoting sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\n\"It was not possible to reach agreement on these things in the room,\" a senior EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the private discussions.\n\nAsked on Thursday about reports that abortion would not be included in the final text, Mr Macron said it was something he regretted.\n\nFrance \"has included women's right to abortion, the freedom of decision on one's own body, into its constitution\", he said, adding that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men\".\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" Mr Macron said.\n\nMs Meloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has denied she is rolling back rights to abortions, which have been legal in Italy since 1978. But the centre-left opposition has warned that her initiatives are chipping away at those rights, including by giving pro-life groups access to women considering abortions.",

        "title": "G7 leaders tackle migration, AI and economic security on final day of summit",
        "body": "The G7 leaders stressed their determination to meet global challenges \"at a crucial moment in history\".\n\nThe gathering in a luxury resort in Italy's southern Puglia region also discussed other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, the war in Gaza, climate change, Iran, the situation in the Red Sea, gender equality and China's industrial policy and economic security.\n\n\"We are working together and with others to address the pressing challenges of our time,\" the G7 leaders said in a final statement, noting their solidarity with Ukraine, support for a deal that would lead to an immediate ceasefire and release of hostages in Gaza, investment in sustainable infrastructure in Africa and commitments to address climate change and migration.\n\nDivisions did emerge during the summit, however, notably over the lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final declaration.\n\nAsked if the G7 gathering has lived up to expectations, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"The aim of the G7 is to create convergence and be able to remove misunderstandings. It's not a place where you decide emergency measures or regulate things.\" He added that there were \"true convergences on Ukraine and Mideast\".\n\n\"It was a useful G7, with useful results,\" Mr Macron said. \"The coming weeks will create the conditions for political opportunities in particular around the two conflicts.\"\n\nMigration was the first topic of discussions on Friday, with the leaders mulling ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.\n\nThe issue is of particular interest to summit host Italy, which lies on one of the major routes into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her hardline stance on migration, has been eager to increase investment and funding for African nations as a means of reducing migratory pressure on Europe.\n\nThe leaders \"launched the G7 Coalition to prevent and counter the smuggling of migrants\", the summit's final declaration said, noting the seven nations would \"focus on the root causes of irregular migration, efforts to enhance border management and curb transnational organised crime, and safe and regular pathways for migration\".\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he and Ms Meloni - whom he described as \"fantastic\" - saw \"eye to eye\" on migration.\n\n\"We can't have criminal gangs decide who comes to our countries,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\nMs Meloni has a controversial five-year deal with neighbouring Albania for the Balkan country to host thousands of asylum seekers while Italy processes their claims. She has also spearheaded the \"Mattei Plan\" for Africa, a continent-wide strategy to increase economic opportunities at home and so discourage migration.\n\nFor its part, Britain has a deal to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, although no flights have yet taken off. Human rights organisations have criticised the agreement as unethical and unworkable.\n\nThe United States has also been struggling with a growing number of migrants. President Joe Biden introduced new policies to curb migration after a Bill he tried to get through Congress failed to pass. However, the future of the new policies is unclear after immigrant rights advocates challenged them with lawsuits.\n\nApart from the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, the Italian hosts also invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Ms Meloni's migration and development initiatives.\n\nBut rights groups decried what they said was a lack of ambition in support for developing countries.\n\nThe ONE Campaign, which advocates for investment in Africa, said it had found the G7 and EU institutions' share of aid going to Africa was at its lowest point since 1973.\n\n\"Without any concrete action, the G7 in Italy amounts to no more than pointless platitudes,\" said David McNair, executive director at The ONE Campaign.\n\nAlthough the summit's final statement \"reflects promises of increased partnership between the G7 and Africa, there are very few specifics on what new financing, if any, will be available\".\n\nPope Francis also became the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, delivering a speech on artificial intelligence. Other invitees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe summit opened on Thursday with a strong show of support for Kyiv: an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion-dollar (£39.5 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denounced the freezing of Russian assets as \"theft\" and vowed it \"will not go unpunished\".\n\nMr Biden also signed a bilateral security agreement with Mr Zelensky, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv.\n\nBut some cracks appeared among the G7 leaders, notably Mr Macron deploring a lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final document.\n\nThe statement after last year's summit in Hiroshima, Japan, expressed a commitment to provide access to safe and legal abortion to women and girls, and pledged to defend gender equality and the rights of members of the LGBT+ community.\n\nThe word \"abortion\" was absent from this year's final communique, although it included a reference to promoting sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\n\"It was not possible to reach agreement on these things in the room,\" a senior EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the private discussions.\n\nAsked on Thursday about reports that abortion would not be included in the final text, Mr Macron said it was something he regretted.\n\nFrance \"has included women's right to abortion, the freedom of decision on one's own body, into its constitution\", he said, adding that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men\".\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" Mr Macron said.\n\nMs Meloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has denied she is rolling back rights to abortions, which have been legal in Italy since 1978. But the centre-left opposition has warned that her initiatives are chipping away at those rights, including by giving pro-life groups access to women considering abortions.",

        "body": "The deal, which parties referred to as a government of national unity, will bring the ANC together in government with the Democratic Alliance (DA), a white-led party that had for years been the main opposition and a fierce foe for the ANC.\n\nAt least two other smaller parties will also be part of the agreement that put South Africa into uncharted waters with the first national coalition government in its democratic history.\n\n\"The government of national unity is on track,\" ANC secretary-general Fikile Mbalula said. \"For the interest of the country, we said let's work together. We have no fear of that.\"\n\nThe agreement was necessary after the ANC lost its 30-year majority in a humbling national election for it last month. It was a turning point for Africa's most industrialised economy. The ANC is the party of Nelson Mandela and had governed with a comfortable majority ever since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994.\n\nThat three-decade dominance ended in the May 29 election, when the ANC's share of the vote dropped to 40% amid discontent from South Africans over high levels of poverty, inequality and unemployment.\n\nAll the parties have said they would put their differences aside to work in the best interests of the country.\n\nHowever, analysts warned there might be complications ahead given the starkly different ideologies of the ANC, a former liberation movement, and the centrist, business-friendly DA -- the two biggest parties and the key players. The DA won 21% of the vote in the national election, the second largest share.\n\nFor one, the DA disagreed with the ANC government's move to accuse Israel of genocide in Gaza in a highly sensitive case at the United Nations' top court.\n\nDA leader John Steenhuisen was the first to confirm that an agreement was dramatically signed on Friday when Parliament was in a break.\n\n\"From today, the DA will co-govern the Republic of South Africa in a spirit of unity and collaboration,\" Mr Steenhuisen said as he broke away from the proceedings to make a speech that was carried live on television. He called it an \"historic step forward.\"\n\nMr Steenhuisen said the DA would back the 71-year-old Mr Ramaphosa for president and because the two parties have a clear joint majority of seats in Parliament, Mr Ramaphosa's re-election now appeared to be assured.\n\nThe Parliament session first went through the hours-long swearing-in of hundreds of new MPs and electing a speaker and a deputy speaker, before the house set to vote on the president, well into the night. Two candidates were nominated -- Mr Ramaphosa and Julius Malema, the leader of the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters party which had refused to join the unity government.\n\nA majority of the votes cast in a secret ballot in the 400-member lower house of Parliament, called the National Assembly, was required to elect a president.\n\nFormer President Jacob Zuma's MK Party was boycotting the session, which did not after the voting as only a third of the house is needed for a quorum.\n\nParliament convened in an unusual setting after a fire in 2022 gutted the National Assembly building in Cape Town and lawmakers came together at a conference centre near the city's waterfront.\n\nTwo other smaller parties said they would be part of the coalition agreement and Mr Mbalula said the ANC was open to talking with anyone else who wanted to join the unity government.\n\nThere are 18 political parties represented in Parliament and Mr Mbalula said the multi-party agreement would \"prioritise the country across the political and ideological divide\". Some parties refused to join.\n\nThe other two parties to join were the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Patriotic Alliance, which has drawn attention because of its strong anti-immigration stance and because its leader, Gayton McKenzie, served a prison sentence for bank robbery.\n\n\"The deal is we are putting South Africa first,\" Mr McKenzie said in an interview on state broadcaster SABC. \"We are going to work together. We have decided we are not going to let South Africa die in our hands, on our watch.\"\n\nThe ANC had faced a deadline to get a coalition agreement given parliament had to sit for the first time and vote for the president within 14 days of the election results being declared on June 2.\n\nThe ANC had been trying to strike a coalition agreement for two weeks and the final negotiations went through the night Thursday and into Friday, party officials said.\n\nSouth Africa had not faced this level of political uncertainty since the ANC swept to power in the first all-race election in 1994 that ended nearly a half-century of racial segregation.\n\nThe party had held a clear majority in parliament since then, meaning parliamentary votes for the president were formalities and every South African leader since had been from the ANC, starting with Mr Mandela.\n\nThis unity government also harked back to the way Mr Mandela, South Africa's first black president, invited political opponents to be part of a new unity government in 1994 in an act of reconciliation. The ANC's hand was forced this time.\n\n\"The ANC has been very magnanimous in that they have accepted defeat and have said, 'let's talk',\" PA leader Mr McKenzie said.",

        "title": "G7 leaders tackle migration, AI and economic security on final day of summit",
        "body": "The G7 leaders stressed their determination to meet global challenges \"at a crucial moment in history\".\n\nThe gathering in a luxury resort in Italy's southern Puglia region also discussed other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, the war in Gaza, climate change, Iran, the situation in the Red Sea, gender equality and China's industrial policy and economic security.\n\n\"We are working together and with others to address the pressing challenges of our time,\" the G7 leaders said in a final statement, noting their solidarity with Ukraine, support for a deal that would lead to an immediate ceasefire and release of hostages in Gaza, investment in sustainable infrastructure in Africa and commitments to address climate change and migration.\n\nDivisions did emerge during the summit, however, notably over the lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final declaration.\n\nAsked if the G7 gathering has lived up to expectations, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"The aim of the G7 is to create convergence and be able to remove misunderstandings. It's not a place where you decide emergency measures or regulate things.\" He added that there were \"true convergences on Ukraine and Mideast\".\n\n\"It was a useful G7, with useful results,\" Mr Macron said. \"The coming weeks will create the conditions for political opportunities in particular around the two conflicts.\"\n\nMigration was the first topic of discussions on Friday, with the leaders mulling ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.\n\nThe issue is of particular interest to summit host Italy, which lies on one of the major routes into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her hardline stance on migration, has been eager to increase investment and funding for African nations as a means of reducing migratory pressure on Europe.\n\nThe leaders \"launched the G7 Coalition to prevent and counter the smuggling of migrants\", the summit's final declaration said, noting the seven nations would \"focus on the root causes of irregular migration, efforts to enhance border management and curb transnational organised crime, and safe and regular pathways for migration\".\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he and Ms Meloni - whom he described as \"fantastic\" - saw \"eye to eye\" on migration.\n\n\"We can't have criminal gangs decide who comes to our countries,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\nMs Meloni has a controversial five-year deal with neighbouring Albania for the Balkan country to host thousands of asylum seekers while Italy processes their claims. She has also spearheaded the \"Mattei Plan\" for Africa, a continent-wide strategy to increase economic opportunities at home and so discourage migration.\n\nFor its part, Britain has a deal to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, although no flights have yet taken off. Human rights organisations have criticised the agreement as unethical and unworkable.\n\nThe United States has also been struggling with a growing number of migrants. President Joe Biden introduced new policies to curb migration after a Bill he tried to get through Congress failed to pass. However, the future of the new policies is unclear after immigrant rights advocates challenged them with lawsuits.\n\nApart from the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, the Italian hosts also invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Ms Meloni's migration and development initiatives.\n\nBut rights groups decried what they said was a lack of ambition in support for developing countries.\n\nThe ONE Campaign, which advocates for investment in Africa, said it had found the G7 and EU institutions' share of aid going to Africa was at its lowest point since 1973.\n\n\"Without any concrete action, the G7 in Italy amounts to no more than pointless platitudes,\" said David McNair, executive director at The ONE Campaign.\n\nAlthough the summit's final statement \"reflects promises of increased partnership between the G7 and Africa, there are very few specifics on what new financing, if any, will be available\".\n\nPope Francis also became the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, delivering a speech on artificial intelligence. Other invitees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe summit opened on Thursday with a strong show of support for Kyiv: an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion-dollar (£39.5 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denounced the freezing of Russian assets as \"theft\" and vowed it \"will not go unpunished\".\n\nMr Biden also signed a bilateral security agreement with Mr Zelensky, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv.\n\nBut some cracks appeared among the G7 leaders, notably Mr Macron deploring a lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final document.\n\nThe statement after last year's summit in Hiroshima, Japan, expressed a commitment to provide access to safe and legal abortion to women and girls, and pledged to defend gender equality and the rights of members of the LGBT+ community.\n\nThe word \"abortion\" was absent from this year's final communique, although it included a reference to promoting sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\n\"It was not possible to reach agreement on these things in the room,\" a senior EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the private discussions.\n\nAsked on Thursday about reports that abortion would not be included in the final text, Mr Macron said it was something he regretted.\n\nFrance \"has included women's right to abortion, the freedom of decision on one's own body, into its constitution\", he said, adding that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men\".\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" Mr Macron said.\n\nMs Meloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has denied she is rolling back rights to abortions, which have been legal in Italy since 1978. But the centre-left opposition has warned that her initiatives are chipping away at those rights, including by giving pro-life groups access to women considering abortions.",

        "summary": "The G7 summit in Italy concluded with leaders addressing key global issues such as migration, artificial intelligence, economic security, and financial support for Ukraine. The leaders emphasized their commitment to tackling these challenges collectively, highlighting solidarity with Ukraine, advocating for a ceasefire in Gaza, and investing in sustainable infrastructure in Africa. However, divisions emerged, particularly over the omission of abortion in the final declaration.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her strict migration policies, pushed for increased investment in African nations to reduce migratory pressures. The G7 launched a coalition to combat migrant smuggling and address the root causes of irregular migration. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak supported Meloni's stance, emphasizing the need to prevent criminal gangs from controlling migration.\n\nThe summit also saw the participation of African leaders and other global figures, including Pope Francis, who spoke on artificial intelligence. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky secured a $50 billion loan backed by frozen Russian assets, a move criticized by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nDespite some agreements, French President Emmanuel Macron expressed disappointment over the lack of a reference to abortion in the final document, contrasting with last year's commitment to women's reproductive rights. Rights groups criticized the summit for its lack of concrete support for developing countries, particularly in Africa.",

        "summary": "The G7 summit in Italy concluded with leaders focusing on migration, artificial intelligence, economic security, and the Indo-Pacific region. Key discussions included financial support for Ukraine, the Gaza conflict, climate change, and China's economic policies. French President Emmanuel Macron highlighted the summit's role in fostering convergence rather than immediate action, noting significant agreements on Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\nMigration was a primary topic, with Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni advocating for increased investment in African nations to reduce migratory pressures. She has a controversial deal with Albania to host asylum seekers and promotes the \"Mattei Plan\" for Africa. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak supported Meloni's stance, emphasizing the need to combat human trafficking.\n\nThe summit also saw the participation of African leaders and a historic address by Pope Francis on artificial intelligence. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky secured a $50 billion loan backed by frozen Russian assets, which Russian President Vladimir Putin condemned.\n\nDespite overall solidarity, there were disagreements, notably on the omission of abortion rights from the final statement, which Macron regretted. The summit's final communique emphasized partnerships with Africa but lacked specifics on new financing, drawing criticism from advocacy groups.",

        "title": "G7 leaders tackle migration, AI and economic security on final day of summit",
        "body": "The G7 leaders stressed their determination to meet global challenges \"at a crucial moment in history\".\n\nThe gathering in a luxury resort in Italy's southern Puglia region also discussed other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, the war in Gaza, climate change, Iran, the situation in the Red Sea, gender equality and China's industrial policy and economic security.\n\n\"We are working together and with others to address the pressing challenges of our time,\" the G7 leaders said in a final statement, noting their solidarity with Ukraine, support for a deal that would lead to an immediate ceasefire and release of hostages in Gaza, investment in sustainable infrastructure in Africa and commitments to address climate change and migration.\n\nDivisions did emerge during the summit, however, notably over the lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final declaration.\n\nAsked if the G7 gathering has lived up to expectations, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"The aim of the G7 is to create convergence and be able to remove misunderstandings. It's not a place where you decide emergency measures or regulate things.\" He added that there were \"true convergences on Ukraine and Mideast\".\n\n\"It was a useful G7, with useful results,\" Mr Macron said. \"The coming weeks will create the conditions for political opportunities in particular around the two conflicts.\"\n\nMigration was the first topic of discussions on Friday, with the leaders mulling ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.\n\nThe issue is of particular interest to summit host Italy, which lies on one of the major routes into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her hardline stance on migration, has been eager to increase investment and funding for African nations as a means of reducing migratory pressure on Europe.\n\nThe leaders \"launched the G7 Coalition to prevent and counter the smuggling of migrants\", the summit's final declaration said, noting the seven nations would \"focus on the root causes of irregular migration, efforts to enhance border management and curb transnational organised crime, and safe and regular pathways for migration\".\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he and Ms Meloni - whom he described as \"fantastic\" - saw \"eye to eye\" on migration.\n\n\"We can't have criminal gangs decide who comes to our countries,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\nMs Meloni has a controversial five-year deal with neighbouring Albania for the Balkan country to host thousands of asylum seekers while Italy processes their claims. She has also spearheaded the \"Mattei Plan\" for Africa, a continent-wide strategy to increase economic opportunities at home and so discourage migration.\n\nFor its part, Britain has a deal to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, although no flights have yet taken off. Human rights organisations have criticised the agreement as unethical and unworkable.\n\nThe United States has also been struggling with a growing number of migrants. President Joe Biden introduced new policies to curb migration after a Bill he tried to get through Congress failed to pass. However, the future of the new policies is unclear after immigrant rights advocates challenged them with lawsuits.\n\nApart from the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, the Italian hosts also invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Ms Meloni's migration and development initiatives.\n\nBut rights groups decried what they said was a lack of ambition in support for developing countries.\n\nThe ONE Campaign, which advocates for investment in Africa, said it had found the G7 and EU institutions' share of aid going to Africa was at its lowest point since 1973.\n\n\"Without any concrete action, the G7 in Italy amounts to no more than pointless platitudes,\" said David McNair, executive director at The ONE Campaign.\n\nAlthough the summit's final statement \"reflects promises of increased partnership between the G7 and Africa, there are very few specifics on what new financing, if any, will be available\".\n\nPope Francis also became the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, delivering a speech on artificial intelligence. Other invitees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe summit opened on Thursday with a strong show of support for Kyiv: an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion-dollar (£39.5 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denounced the freezing of Russian assets as \"theft\" and vowed it \"will not go unpunished\".\n\nMr Biden also signed a bilateral security agreement with Mr Zelensky, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv.\n\nBut some cracks appeared among the G7 leaders, notably Mr Macron deploring a lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final document.\n\nThe statement after last year's summit in Hiroshima, Japan, expressed a commitment to provide access to safe and legal abortion to women and girls, and pledged to defend gender equality and the rights of members of the LGBT+ community.\n\nThe word \"abortion\" was absent from this year's final communique, although it included a reference to promoting sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\n\"It was not possible to reach agreement on these things in the room,\" a senior EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the private discussions.\n\nAsked on Thursday about reports that abortion would not be included in the final text, Mr Macron said it was something he regretted.\n\nFrance \"has included women's right to abortion, the freedom of decision on one's own body, into its constitution\", he said, adding that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men\".\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" Mr Macron said.\n\nMs Meloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has denied she is rolling back rights to abortions, which have been legal in Italy since 1978. But the centre-left opposition has warned that her initiatives are chipping away at those rights, including by giving pro-life groups access to women considering abortions.",

        "body": "The G7 leaders stressed their determination to meet global challenges \"at a crucial moment in history\".\n\nThe gathering in a luxury resort in Italy's southern Puglia region also discussed other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, the war in Gaza, climate change, Iran, the situation in the Red Sea, gender equality and China's industrial policy and economic security.\n\n\"We are working together and with others to address the pressing challenges of our time,\" the G7 leaders said in a final statement, noting their solidarity with Ukraine, support for a deal that would lead to an immediate ceasefire and release of hostages in Gaza, investment in sustainable infrastructure in Africa and commitments to address climate change and migration.\n\nDivisions did emerge during the summit, however, notably over the lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final declaration.\n\nAsked if the G7 gathering has lived up to expectations, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"The aim of the G7 is to create convergence and be able to remove misunderstandings. It's not a place where you decide emergency measures or regulate things.\" He added that there were \"true convergences on Ukraine and Mideast\".\n\n\"It was a useful G7, with useful results,\" Mr Macron said. \"The coming weeks will create the conditions for political opportunities in particular around the two conflicts.\"\n\nMigration was the first topic of discussions on Friday, with the leaders mulling ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.\n\nThe issue is of particular interest to summit host Italy, which lies on one of the major routes into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her hardline stance on migration, has been eager to increase investment and funding for African nations as a means of reducing migratory pressure on Europe.\n\nThe leaders \"launched the G7 Coalition to prevent and counter the smuggling of migrants\", the summit's final declaration said, noting the seven nations would \"focus on the root causes of irregular migration, efforts to enhance border management and curb transnational organised crime, and safe and regular pathways for migration\".\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he and Ms Meloni - whom he described as \"fantastic\" - saw \"eye to eye\" on migration.\n\n\"We can't have criminal gangs decide who comes to our countries,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\nMs Meloni has a controversial five-year deal with neighbouring Albania for the Balkan country to host thousands of asylum seekers while Italy processes their claims. She has also spearheaded the \"Mattei Plan\" for Africa, a continent-wide strategy to increase economic opportunities at home and so discourage migration.\n\nFor its part, Britain has a deal to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, although no flights have yet taken off. Human rights organisations have criticised the agreement as unethical and unworkable.\n\nThe United States has also been struggling with a growing number of migrants. President Joe Biden introduced new policies to curb migration after a Bill he tried to get through Congress failed to pass. However, the future of the new policies is unclear after immigrant rights advocates challenged them with lawsuits.\n\nApart from the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, the Italian hosts also invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Ms Meloni's migration and development initiatives.\n\nBut rights groups decried what they said was a lack of ambition in support for developing countries.\n\nThe ONE Campaign, which advocates for investment in Africa, said it had found the G7 and EU institutions' share of aid going to Africa was at its lowest point since 1973.\n\n\"Without any concrete action, the G7 in Italy amounts to no more than pointless platitudes,\" said David McNair, executive director at The ONE Campaign.\n\nAlthough the summit's final statement \"reflects promises of increased partnership between the G7 and Africa, there are very few specifics on what new financing, if any, will be available\".\n\nPope Francis also became the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, delivering a speech on artificial intelligence. Other invitees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe summit opened on Thursday with a strong show of support for Kyiv: an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion-dollar (£39.5 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denounced the freezing of Russian assets as \"theft\" and vowed it \"will not go unpunished\".\n\nMr Biden also signed a bilateral security agreement with Mr Zelensky, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv.\n\nBut some cracks appeared among the G7 leaders, notably Mr Macron deploring a lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final document.\n\nThe statement after last year's summit in Hiroshima, Japan, expressed a commitment to provide access to safe and legal abortion to women and girls, and pledged to defend gender equality and the rights of members of the LGBT+ community.\n\nThe word \"abortion\" was absent from this year's final communique, although it included a reference to promoting sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\n\"It was not possible to reach agreement on these things in the room,\" a senior EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the private discussions.\n\nAsked on Thursday about reports that abortion would not be included in the final text, Mr Macron said it was something he regretted.\n\nFrance \"has included women's right to abortion, the freedom of decision on one's own body, into its constitution\", he said, adding that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men\".\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" Mr Macron said.\n\nMs Meloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has denied she is rolling back rights to abortions, which have been legal in Italy since 1978. But the centre-left opposition has warned that her initiatives are chipping away at those rights, including by giving pro-life groups access to women considering abortions.",

The leaders emphasized their commitment to tackling these challenges collectively, expressing solidarity with Ukraine and support for a ceasefire in Gaza. They also launched a coalition to combat migrant smuggling and discussed investment in sustainable infrastructure in Africa.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her strict migration policies, pushed for increased investment in African nations to reduce migratory pressures. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak supported her stance, while the U.S. and other G7 nations also grappled with migration issues.\n\nThe summit saw some divisions, particularly over the omission of abortion from the final declaration, a point lamented by French President Emmanuel Macron. Despite this, Macron described the summit as productive, with significant convergences on Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\nPope Francis addressed the summit on artificial intelligence, and other notable attendees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and leaders from Brazil, India, and Turkey. The summit opened with a strong show of support for Ukraine, including a $50 billion loan backed by frozen Russian assets, which Russian President Vladimir Putin condemned.\n\nRights groups criticized the G7 for a lack of concrete action in supporting developing countries, particularly in Africa.

It's not a place where you decide emergency measures or regulate things.\" He added that there were \"true convergences on Ukraine and Mideast\".\n\n\"It was a useful G7, with useful results,\" Mr Macron said. \"The coming weeks will create the conditions for political opportunities in particular around the two conflicts.\"\n\nMigration was the first topic of discussions on Friday, with the leaders mulling ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.\n\nThe issue is of particular interest to summit host Italy, which lies on one of the major routes into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her hardline stance on migration, has been eager to increase investment and funding for African nations as a means of reducing migratory pressure on Europe.\n\nThe leaders \"launched the G7 Coalition to prevent and counter the smuggling of migrants\", the summit's final declaration said, noting the seven nations would \"focus on the root causes of irregular migration, efforts to enhance border management and curb transnational organised crime, and safe and regular pathways for migration\".\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he and Ms Meloni - whom he described as \"fantastic\" - saw \"eye to eye\" on migration.\n\n\"We can't have criminal gangs decide who comes to our countries,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\nMs Meloni has a controversial five-year deal with neighbouring Albania for the Balkan country to host thousands of asylum seekers while Italy processes their claims. She has also spearheaded the \"Mattei Plan\" for Africa, a continent-wide strategy to increase economic opportunities at home and so discourage migration.\n\nFor its part, Britain has a deal to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, although no flights have yet taken off. Human rights organisations have criticised the agreement as unethical and unworkable.\n\nThe United States has also been struggling with a growing number of migrants. President Joe Biden introduced new policies to curb migration after a Bill he tried to get through Congress failed to pass. However, the future of the new policies is unclear after immigrant rights advocates challenged them with lawsuits.\n\nApart from the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, the Italian hosts also invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Ms Meloni's migration and development initiatives.\n\nBut rights groups decried what they said was a lack of ambition in support for developing countries.\n\nThe ONE Campaign, which advocates for investment in Africa, said it had found the G7 and EU institutions' share of aid going to Africa was at its lowest point since 1973.\n\n\"Without any concrete action, the G7 in Italy amounts to no more than pointless platitudes,\" said David McNair, executive director at The ONE Campaign.\n\nAlthough the summit's final statement \"reflects promises of increased partnership between the G7 and Africa, there are very few specifics on what new financing, if any, will be available\".\n\nPope Francis also became the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, delivering a speech on artificial intelligence. Other invitees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe summit opened on Thursday with a strong show of support for Kyiv: an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion-dollar (£39.5 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denounced the freezing of Russian assets as \"theft\" and vowed it \"will not go unpunished\".\n\nMr Biden also signed a bilateral security agreement with Mr Zelensky, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv.\n\nBut some cracks appeared among the G7 leaders, notably Mr Macron deploring a lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final document.\n\nThe statement after last year's summit in Hiroshima, Japan, expressed a commitment to provide access to safe and legal abortion to women and girls, and pledged to defend gender equality and the rights of members of the LGBT+ community.\n\nThe word \"abortion\" was absent from this year's final communique, although it included a reference to promoting sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\n\"It was not possible to reach agreement on these things in the room,\" a senior EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the private discussions.\n\nAsked on Thursday about reports that abortion would not be included in the final text, Mr Macron said it was something he regretted.\n\nFrance \"has included women's right to abortion, the freedom of decision on one's own body, into its constitution\", he said, adding that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men\".\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" Mr Macron said.\n\nMs Meloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has denied she is rolling back rights to abortions, which have been legal in Italy since 1978.

The G7 agreed on a $50 billion loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets, which Russian President Vladimir Putin condemned. Despite some disagreements, French President Emmanuel Macron described the summit as productive, particularly on issues concerning Ukraine and the Middle East.",

Despite some agreements, rights groups criticized the summit for lacking concrete support for developing countries.",

        "body": "The Group of Seven leading industrialised nations turned their attention to migration, artificial intelligence, economic security and the Indo-Pacific region on Friday, the second and final day of their summit in Italy.\n\nThe G7 leaders stressed their determination to meet global challenges \"at a crucial moment in history\".\n\nThe gathering in a luxury resort in Italy's southern Puglia region also discussed other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, the war in Gaza, climate change, Iran, the situation in the Red Sea, gender equality and China's industrial policy and economic security.\n\n\"We are working together and with others to address the pressing challenges of our time,\" the G7 leaders said in a final statement, noting their solidarity with Ukraine, support for a deal that would lead to an immediate ceasefire and release of hostages in Gaza, investment in sustainable infrastructure in Africa and commitments to address climate change and migration.\n\nDivisions did emerge during the summit, however, notably over the lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final declaration.\n\nAsked if the G7 gathering has lived up to expectations, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"The aim of the G7 is to create convergence and be able to remove misunderstandings. It's not a place where you decide emergency measures or regulate things.\" He added that there were \"true convergences on Ukraine and Mideast\".\n\n\"It was a useful G7, with useful results,\" Mr Macron said. \"The coming weeks will create the conditions for political opportunities in particular around the two conflicts.\"\n\nMigration was the first topic of discussions on Friday, with the leaders mulling ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.\n\nThe issue is of particular interest to summit host Italy, which lies on one of the major routes into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her hardline stance on migration, has been eager to increase investment and funding for African nations as a means of reducing migratory pressure on Europe.\n\nThe leaders \"launched the G7 Coalition to prevent and counter the smuggling of migrants\", the summit's final declaration said, noting the seven nations would \"focus on the root causes of irregular migration, efforts to enhance border management and curb transnational organised crime, and safe and regular pathways for migration\".\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he and Ms Meloni - whom he described as \"fantastic\" - saw \"eye to eye\" on migration.\n\n\"We can't have criminal gangs decide who comes to our countries,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\nMs Meloni has a controversial five-year deal with neighbouring Albania for the Balkan country to host thousands of asylum seekers while Italy processes their claims. She has also spearheaded the \"Mattei Plan\" for Africa, a continent-wide strategy to increase economic opportunities at home and so discourage migration.\n\nFor its part, Britain has a deal to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, although no flights have yet taken off. Human rights organisations have criticised the agreement as unethical and unworkable.\n\nThe United States has also been struggling with a growing number of migrants. President Joe Biden introduced new policies to curb migration after a Bill he tried to get through Congress failed to pass. However, the future of the new policies is unclear after immigrant rights advocates challenged them with lawsuits.\n\nApart from the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, the Italian hosts also invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Ms Meloni's migration and development initiatives.\n\nBut rights groups decried what they said was a lack of ambition in support for developing countries.\n\nThe ONE Campaign, which advocates for investment in Africa, said it had found the G7 and EU institutions' share of aid going to Africa was at its lowest point since 1973.\n\n\"Without any concrete action, the G7 in Italy amounts to no more than pointless platitudes,\" said David McNair, executive director at The ONE Campaign.\n\nAlthough the summit's final statement \"reflects promises of increased partnership between the G7 and Africa, there are very few specifics on what new financing, if any, will be available\".\n\nPope Francis also became the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, delivering a speech on artificial intelligence. Other invitees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe summit opened on Thursday with a strong show of support for Kyiv: an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion-dollar (£39.5 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denounced the freezing of Russian assets as \"theft\" and vowed it \"will not go unpunished\".\n\nMr Biden also signed a bilateral security agreement with Mr Zelensky, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv.\n\nBut some cracks appeared among the G7 leaders, notably Mr Macron deploring a lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final document.\n\nThe statement after last year's summit in Hiroshima, Japan, expressed a commitment to provide access to safe and legal abortion to women and girls, and pledged to defend gender equality and the rights of members of the LGBT+ community.\n\nThe word \"abortion\" was absent from this year's final communique, although it included a reference to promoting sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\n\"It was not possible to reach agreement on these things in the room,\" a senior EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the private discussions.\n\nAsked on Thursday about reports that abortion would not be included in the final text, Mr Macron said it was something he regretted.\n\nFrance \"has included women's right to abortion, the freedom of decision on one's own body, into its constitution\", he said, adding that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men\".\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" Mr Macron said.\n\nMs Meloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has denied she is rolling back rights to abortions, which have been legal in Italy since 1978. But the centre-left opposition has warned that her initiatives are chipping away at those rights, including by giving pro-life groups access to women considering abortions.",

We have no fear of that.\"\n\nThe agreement was necessary after the ANC lost its 30-year majority in a humbling national election for it last month. It was a turning point for Africa's most industrialised economy. The ANC is the party of Nelson Mandela and had governed with a comfortable majority ever since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994.\n\nThat three-decade dominance ended in the May 29 election, when the ANC's share of the vote dropped to 40% amid discontent from South Africans over high levels of poverty, inequality and unemployment.\n\nAll the parties have said they would put their differences aside to work in the best interests of the country.\n\nHowever, analysts warned there might be complications ahead given the starkly different ideologies of the ANC, a former liberation movement, and the centrist, business-friendly DA -- the two biggest parties and the key players. The DA won 21% of the vote in the national election, the second largest share.\n\nFor one, the DA disagreed with the ANC government's move to accuse Israel of genocide in Gaza in a highly sensitive case at the United Nations' top court.\n\nDA leader John Steenhuisen was the first to confirm that an agreement was dramatically signed on Friday when Parliament was in a break.\n\n\"From today, the DA will co-govern the Republic of South Africa in a spirit of unity and collaboration,\" Mr Steenhuisen said as he broke away from the proceedings to make a speech that was carried live on television. He called it an \"historic step forward.\"\n\nMr Steenhuisen said the DA would back the 71-year-old Mr Ramaphosa for president and because the two parties have a clear joint majority of seats in Parliament, Mr Ramaphosa's re-election now appeared to be assured.\n\nThe Parliament session first went through the hours-long swearing-in of hundreds of new MPs and electing a speaker and a deputy speaker, before the house set to vote on the president, well into the night. Two candidates were nominated -- Mr Ramaphosa and Julius Malema, the leader of the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters party which had refused to join the unity government.\n\nA majority of the votes cast in a secret ballot in the 400-member lower house of Parliament, called the National Assembly, was required to elect a president.\n\nFormer President Jacob Zuma's MK Party was boycotting the session, which did not after the voting as only a third of the house is needed for a quorum.\n\nParliament convened in an unusual setting after a fire in 2022 gutted the National Assembly building in Cape Town and lawmakers came together at a conference centre near the city's waterfront.\n\nTwo other smaller parties said they would be part of the coalition agreement and Mr Mbalula said the ANC was open to talking with anyone else who wanted to join the unity government.\n\nThere are 18 political parties represented in Parliament and Mr Mbalula said the multi-party agreement would \"prioritise the country across the political and ideological divide\". Some parties refused to join.\n\nThe other two parties to join were the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Patriotic Alliance, which has drawn attention because of its strong anti-immigration stance and because its leader, Gayton McKenzie, served a prison sentence for bank robbery.\n\n\"The deal is we are putting South Africa first,\" Mr McKenzie said in an interview on state broadcaster SABC. \"We are going to work together. We have decided we are not going to let South Africa die in our hands, on our watch.\"\n\nThe ANC had faced a deadline to get a coalition agreement given parliament had to sit for the first time and vote for the president within 14 days of the election results being declared on June 2.\n\nThe ANC had been trying to strike a coalition agreement for two weeks and the final negotiations went through the night Thursday and into Friday, party officials said.\n\nSouth Africa had not faced this level of political uncertainty since the ANC swept to power in the first all-race election in 1994 that ended nearly a half-century of racial segregation.\n\nThe party had held a clear majority in parliament since then, meaning parliamentary votes for the president were formalities and every South African leader since had been from the ANC, starting with Mr Mandela.\n\nThis unity government also harked back to the way Mr Mandela, South Africa's first black president, invited political opponents to be part of a new unity government in 1994 in an act of reconciliation. The ANC's hand was forced this time.\n\n\"The ANC has been very magnanimous in that they have accepted defeat and have said, 'let's talk',\" PA leader Mr McKenzie said.",

        "summary": "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is set for re-election following a historic coalition agreement between the African National Congress (ANC) and the Democratic Alliance (DA), marking the first national coalition government in the country's democratic history. The ANC, which lost its 30-year majority in a recent election, will govern alongside the DA and at least two smaller parties, the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Patriotic Alliance. The coalition aims to address national issues despite differing ideologies, with the DA securing 21% of the vote and agreeing to support Ramaphosa. The agreement was finalized just before a parliamentary deadline, ensuring Ramaphosa's re-election. The coalition reflects a significant political shift, reminiscent of Nelson Mandela's unity government in 1994.",

        "title": "G7 leaders tackle migration, AI and economic security on final day of summit",
        "body": "The G7 leaders stressed their determination to meet global challenges \"at a crucial moment in history\".\n\nThe gathering in a luxury resort in Italy's southern Puglia region also discussed other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, the war in Gaza, climate change, Iran, the situation in the Red Sea, gender equality and China's industrial policy and economic security.\n\n\"We are working together and with others to address the pressing challenges of our time,\" the G7 leaders said in a final statement, noting their solidarity with Ukraine, support for a deal that would lead to an immediate ceasefire and release of hostages in Gaza, investment in sustainable infrastructure in Africa and commitments to address climate change and migration.\n\nDivisions did emerge during the summit, however, notably over the lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final declaration.\n\nAsked if the G7 gathering has lived up to expectations, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"The aim of the G7 is to create convergence and be able to remove misunderstandings. It's not a place where you decide emergency measures or regulate things.\" He added that there were \"true convergences on Ukraine and Mideast\".\n\n\"It was a useful G7, with useful results,\" Mr Macron said. \"The coming weeks will create the conditions for political opportunities in particular around the two conflicts.\"\n\nMigration was the first topic of discussions on Friday, with the leaders mulling ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.\n\nThe issue is of particular interest to summit host Italy, which lies on one of the major routes into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her hardline stance on migration, has been eager to increase investment and funding for African nations as a means of reducing migratory pressure on Europe.\n\nThe leaders \"launched the G7 Coalition to prevent and counter the smuggling of migrants\", the summit's final declaration said, noting the seven nations would \"focus on the root causes of irregular migration, efforts to enhance border management and curb transnational organised crime, and safe and regular pathways for migration\".\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he and Ms Meloni - whom he described as \"fantastic\" - saw \"eye to eye\" on migration.\n\n\"We can't have criminal gangs decide who comes to our countries,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\nMs Meloni has a controversial five-year deal with neighbouring Albania for the Balkan country to host thousands of asylum seekers while Italy processes their claims. She has also spearheaded the \"Mattei Plan\" for Africa, a continent-wide strategy to increase economic opportunities at home and so discourage migration.\n\nFor its part, Britain has a deal to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, although no flights have yet taken off. Human rights organisations have criticised the agreement as unethical and unworkable.\n\nThe United States has also been struggling with a growing number of migrants. President Joe Biden introduced new policies to curb migration after a Bill he tried to get through Congress failed to pass. However, the future of the new policies is unclear after immigrant rights advocates challenged them with lawsuits.\n\nApart from the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, the Italian hosts also invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Ms Meloni's migration and development initiatives.\n\nBut rights groups decried what they said was a lack of ambition in support for developing countries.\n\nThe ONE Campaign, which advocates for investment in Africa, said it had found the G7 and EU institutions' share of aid going to Africa was at its lowest point since 1973.\n\n\"Without any concrete action, the G7 in Italy amounts to no more than pointless platitudes,\" said David McNair, executive director at The ONE Campaign.\n\nAlthough the summit's final statement \"reflects promises of increased partnership between the G7 and Africa, there are very few specifics on what new financing, if any, will be available\".\n\nPope Francis also became the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, delivering a speech on artificial intelligence. Other invitees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe summit opened on Thursday with a strong show of support for Kyiv: an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion-dollar (£39.5 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denounced the freezing of Russian assets as \"theft\" and vowed it \"will not go unpunished\".\n\nMr Biden also signed a bilateral security agreement with Mr Zelensky, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv.\n\nBut some cracks appeared among the G7 leaders, notably Mr Macron deploring a lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final document.\n\nThe statement after last year's summit in Hiroshima, Japan, expressed a commitment to provide access to safe and legal abortion to women and girls, and pledged to defend gender equality and the rights of members of the LGBT+ community.\n\nThe word \"abortion\" was absent from this year's final communique, although it included a reference to promoting sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\n\"It was not possible to reach agreement on these things in the room,\" a senior EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the private discussions.\n\nAsked on Thursday about reports that abortion would not be included in the final text, Mr Macron said it was something he regretted.\n\nFrance \"has included women's right to abortion, the freedom of decision on one's own body, into its constitution\", he said, adding that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men\".\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" Mr Macron said.\n\nMs Meloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has denied she is rolling back rights to abortions, which have been legal in Italy since 1978. But the centre-left opposition has warned that her initiatives are chipping away at those rights, including by giving pro-life groups access to women considering abortions.",

        "title": "G7 leaders tackle migration, AI and economic security on final day of summit",
        "body": "The G7 leaders stressed their determination to meet global challenges \"at a crucial moment in history\".\n\nThe gathering in a luxury resort in Italy's southern Puglia region also discussed other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, the war in Gaza, climate change, Iran, the situation in the Red Sea, gender equality and China's industrial policy and economic security.\n\n\"We are working together and with others to address the pressing challenges of our time,\" the G7 leaders said in a final statement, noting their solidarity with Ukraine, support for a deal that would lead to an immediate ceasefire and release of hostages in Gaza, investment in sustainable infrastructure in Africa and commitments to address climate change and migration.\n\nDivisions did emerge during the summit, however, notably over the lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final declaration.\n\nAsked if the G7 gathering has lived up to expectations, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"The aim of the G7 is to create convergence and be able to remove misunderstandings. It's not a place where you decide emergency measures or regulate things.\" He added that there were \"true convergences on Ukraine and Mideast\".\n\n\"It was a useful G7, with useful results,\" Mr Macron said. \"The coming weeks will create the conditions for political opportunities in particular around the two conflicts.\"\n\nMigration was the first topic of discussions on Friday, with the leaders mulling ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.\n\nThe issue is of particular interest to summit host Italy, which lies on one of the major routes into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her hardline stance on migration, has been eager to increase investment and funding for African nations as a means of reducing migratory pressure on Europe.\n\nThe leaders \"launched the G7 Coalition to prevent and counter the smuggling of migrants\", the summit's final declaration said, noting the seven nations would \"focus on the root causes of irregular migration, efforts to enhance border management and curb transnational organised crime, and safe and regular pathways for migration\".\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he and Ms Meloni - whom he described as \"fantastic\" - saw \"eye to eye\" on migration.\n\n\"We can't have criminal gangs decide who comes to our countries,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\nMs Meloni has a controversial five-year deal with neighbouring Albania for the Balkan country to host thousands of asylum seekers while Italy processes their claims. She has also spearheaded the \"Mattei Plan\" for Africa, a continent-wide strategy to increase economic opportunities at home and so discourage migration.\n\nFor its part, Britain has a deal to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, although no flights have yet taken off. Human rights organisations have criticised the agreement as unethical and unworkable.\n\nThe United States has also been struggling with a growing number of migrants. President Joe Biden introduced new policies to curb migration after a Bill he tried to get through Congress failed to pass. However, the future of the new policies is unclear after immigrant rights advocates challenged them with lawsuits.\n\nApart from the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, the Italian hosts also invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Ms Meloni's migration and development initiatives.\n\nBut rights groups decried what they said was a lack of ambition in support for developing countries.\n\nThe ONE Campaign, which advocates for investment in Africa, said it had found the G7 and EU institutions' share of aid going to Africa was at its lowest point since 1973.\n\n\"Without any concrete action, the G7 in Italy amounts to no more than pointless platitudes,\" said David McNair, executive director at The ONE Campaign.\n\nAlthough the summit's final statement \"reflects promises of increased partnership between the G7 and Africa, there are very few specifics on what new financing, if any, will be available\".\n\nPope Francis also became the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, delivering a speech on artificial intelligence. Other invitees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe summit opened on Thursday with a strong show of support for Kyiv: an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion-dollar (£39.5 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denounced the freezing of Russian assets as \"theft\" and vowed it \"will not go unpunished\".\n\nMr Biden also signed a bilateral security agreement with Mr Zelensky, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv.\n\nBut some cracks appeared among the G7 leaders, notably Mr Macron deploring a lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final document.\n\nThe statement after last year's summit in Hiroshima, Japan, expressed a commitment to provide access to safe and legal abortion to women and girls, and pledged to defend gender equality and the rights of members of the LGBT+ community.\n\nThe word \"abortion\" was absent from this year's final communique, although it included a reference to promoting sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\n\"It was not possible to reach agreement on these things in the room,\" a senior EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the private discussions.\n\nAsked on Thursday about reports that abortion would not be included in the final text, Mr Macron said it was something he regretted.\n\nFrance \"has included women's right to abortion, the freedom of decision on one's own body, into its constitution\", he said, adding that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men\".\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" Mr Macron said.\n\nMs Meloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has denied she is rolling back rights to abortions, which have been legal in Italy since 1978. But the centre-left opposition has warned that her initiatives are chipping away at those rights, including by giving pro-life groups access to women considering abortions.",

However, rights groups criticized the G7 for a lack of concrete support for developing countries, particularly in Africa.",

        "body": "This live is now closed. Follow The Hindu for more updates.\n\nIndia's election results were a \"victory for the democratic world\", Prime Minister Narendra Modi told G-7 countries and leaders of other nations invited to the Outreach Summit in Italy, praising the use of Electronic Voting Machines (EVM) technology in Indian elections for their \"impartiality and transparency\".\n\nSpeaking at a session that focussed on Artificial Intelligence, and other issues including African development and the \"Mediterranean\", with Pope Francis who addressed the G7 session for the first time, Mr. Modi said that technology must be used to reduce inequalities.\n\nMr. Modi met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the side-lines of the G7 outreach summit a day ahead of the Swiss Peace Summit on Ukraine, promising to support a peaceful resolution, even though he will not himself will not travel to Switzerland.\n\nEarlier, the G7 leaders called on China to stop sending weapons components to Russia that are fuelling its war against Ukraine, according to a draft statement.\n\nMr. Modi on June 14 met French President Emmanuel Macron and believed to have discussed ways to further bolster the bilateral ties and exchanged views on global issues. The two leaders met on the sidelines of the G7 summit, in Bari, in the southern Italian resort city. Further, Mr. Modi also met his British counterpart Rishi Sunak and is believed to have discussed bilateral relations and issues of common interests.\n\nLeaders of the G7 wealthy nations gather in southern Italy this week against the backdrop of global and political turmoil, with boosting support for Ukraine top of the agenda.\n\nPM Modi met Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau at the G7 Summit.\n\nThis was their first face-to-face meeting after Mr. Trudeau claimed that the Indian government agents were involved in the killing of a Khalistani separatist in Canada last year. Canada has arrested four Indian nationals in connection with the case.\n\nThe ties between India and Canada were severely strained following Mr. Trudeau's allegations. India has dismissed Mr. Trudeau's charges as \"absurd\" and \"motivated.\" \"Pleased to meet @UN Secretary General, Mr. @antonioguterres in Italy,\" Mr. Modi said in a post on X.\n\nPrime Minister Modi had a \"good meeting\" with UN chief Guterres, his office said.\n\nMr. Modi also met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Brazil President Lula da Silva and UAE President Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.\n\n\"The interactions in Italy continue...Delightful conversation with President @LulaOficial, President @RTErdogan and His Highness Sheikh @MohamedBinZayed,\" Mr. Modi posted along on X with a photo with them.\n\nPM Modi had a \"wonderful conversation\" with the three leaders, the PMO said.\n\nHe also met Jordan's King Abdullah II on the sidelines of the G7 Summit. \"India values the strong ties with Jordan,\" he said.\n\nExchanging greetings with U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday, PM Modi said it's always a pleasure to meet him. \"India and the U.S. will continue to to work together to further the global good,\" he added.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday conveyed to Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a meeting that India would continue to do everything within its means to support a peaceful solution to the Ukraine conflict and that the way to peace is through \"dialogue and diplomacy\".\n\nDuring the meeting, Mr. Modi told Mr. Zelenskyy that India believes in a \"human-centric\" approach to find a solution to the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nIn a post on 'X', the Ukrainian President said he and Mr. Modi talked about the Peace Summit and issues on its agenda and that he thanked the Indian Prime Minister for sending a high-level delegation to it.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin promised Friday to \"immediately\" order a cease-fire in Ukraine and start negotiations if Kyiv began withdrawing troops from the four regions annexed by Moscow in 2022 and renounced plans to join NATO. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected what he called an ultimatum by Putin to surrender more territory.\n\nMr. Putin's remarks came as Switzerland prepared to host scores of world leaders -- but not from Moscow -- this weekend to try to map out first steps toward peace in Ukraine.\n\nThey also coincided with a meeting of leaders of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations in Italy and after the U.S. and Ukraine this week signed a 10-year security agreement that Russian officials, including Putin, denounced as \"null and void.\"\n\n- AP\n\n\"Countries of Global South are bearing brunt of global uncertainties and tensions,\" said Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the G7 Outreach session.\n\n\"We must make technology creative, not destructive. Only then will we be able to lay foundation of inclusive society,\" Mr. Modi said at the session, adding: \"India is among first few countries to formulate a national strategy in Artificial Intelligence.\"\n\n\"During G-20 Summit hosted by India last year, we stressed on importance of international governance in field of AI,\" the Prime Minister said.\n\n\"In these efforts, we have given high priority to Africa. We are proud that the G-20, under the chairmanship of India, made the African Union a permanent member,\" he said.\n\n\"India has been contributing to the economic and social development, stability and security of all the countries of Africa, and will continue to do so in the future,\" Mr. Modi said.\n\nThe Prime Minister spoke extensively on the importance of ending monopoly in technology with a particular emphasis on artificial intelligence.\n\n\"We must make technology creative, not destructive. Only then will we be able to lay the foundation of an inclusive society. India is striving for a better future through this human-centric approach,\" he said.\n\n- PTI\n\nG7 leaders said the UN Palestinian refugee agency must be allowed to work unhindered in Gaza, in the draft of an end-of-summit statement seen by AFP Friday.\n\n\"We agree it is critical that UNRWA and other UN organisations and agencies' distribution networks be fully able to deliver aid to those who need it most, fulfilling their mandate effectively,\" the Group of Seven nations said.\n\nThey called for all parties to facilitate \"rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians in need\" in Gaza, particularly women and children.\n\n\"Securing full, rapid, safe, and unhindered humanitarian access in all its forms -- consistent with international humanitarian law, and through all relevant land crossing points, including the Rafah crossing, through maritime delivery routes, including through Ashdod Port -- and throughout all of Gaza remains an absolute priority,\" they said.\n\n- AFP\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni had a lot to talk about Friday when they met on the sidelines of the Group of Seven summit, but one notable matter wasn't on the table: That's abortion, an issue that emerged as an unexpected friction point among the democracies gathered in Italy.\n\nA White House readout of the Mr. Biden-Ms. Meloni meeting made no reference to the issue and instead emphasized their common efforts to \"deepen the U.S.-Italy partnership across a range of vital security, economic, and regional issues.\" It cited Ms. Meloni's \"steadfast support for Ukraine as it continues to defend itself from Russia's brutal war of aggression, including Italy's critical security assistance.\"\n\n- AP\n\nPope Francis challenged leaders of the world's wealthy democracies on Friday to keep human dignity foremost in developing and using artificial intelligence, warning that such powerful technology risks turning human relations themselves into mere algorithms.\n\nThe pope brought his moral authority to bear on the Group of Seven, invited by host Italy to address a special session at their annual summit on the perils and promises of AI. In doing so, he became the first pope to attend the G7, offering an ethical take on an issue that is increasingly on the agenda of international summits, government policy and corporate boards alike.\n\nHe said politicians must take the lead in making AI human-centric, so that human decisions always remain made by humans and not machines.\n\n\"We would condemn humanity to a future without hope if we took away people's ability to make decisions about themselves and their lives, by dooming them to depend on the choices of machines,\" he said. \"We need to ensure and safeguard a space for proper human control over the choices made by artificial intelligence programmes: Human dignity itself depends on it.\" The pope intended to use the occasion to join the chorus of countries and global bodies pushing for stronger guardrails on AI following the boom in generative artificial intelligence kickstarted by OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot.\n\n- AP\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi is attending the 'Outreach Session' of the Group of Seven (G7) Summit in Italy on Friday.\n\nPM Modi met Pope Francis upon reaching the Summit after he was welcomed by Italy's PM Giorgia Meloni as India participated as an 'Outreach Nation' in the G7 Summit.\n\nVisuals from the session showed PM Modi sharing a hug with Pope Francis. PM Modi was seated next to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of the United Kingdom and the two were seen having a discussion.\n\nPM Modi will also address the 'Outreach Session' of the G7 Summit.\n\n- ANI\n\nLeaders of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations turned their attention to migration at the start of the second day of their summit Friday, seeking ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.\n\nThe gathering in a luxury resort in Italy's southern Puglia region is also discussing other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, the war in Gaza, artificial intelligence, climate change, as well as China's industrial policy and economic security.\n\nBut some divisions also appeared to emerge over the wording of the summit's final declaration, with disagreement reported over the inclusion of a reference to abortion.\n\n- AP\n\nPope Francis called Friday for a ban on \"lethal autonomous weapons\", as he addressed the G7 leaders' summit in Italy on the perils of artificial intelligence.\n\n\"In light of the tragedy that is armed conflict, it is urgent to reconsider the development and use of devices like the so-called 'lethal autonomous weapons' and ultimately ban their use,\" the pope said.\n\n- AFP\n\nLeaders of the Group of Seven major democracies held their second and final day of talks on Friday at their annual summit.

        "body": "The crew of a ship that was holed in an attack by Yemen's Huthi rebels has been evacuated and the vessel is drifting in the Red Sea, a security agency said on Friday.\n\nThe MV Tutor was abandoned after it was struck by a sea drone off rebel-held Hodeida on Wednesday, causing serious flooding, in the latest in a series of Huthi attacks.\n\nThe Iran-backed rebels have been harassing the vital sealane since shortly after the start of the Israel-Hamas war, forcing much marine traffic into lengthy detours.\n\n\"The crew of the vessel has been evacuated by military authorities,\" said the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, which is run by the British navy.\n\n\"The vessel has been abandoned and is drifting.\"\n\nPhilippines President Ferdinand Marcos had earlier pledged to help the Filipino seamen on board and transfer them to Djibouti, across the Red Sea from Yemen, with the UKMTO's help.\n\n\"We are doing everything that we can do,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe Liberian-flagged, Greek-owned and operated merchant ship was hit by a sea drone and an \"unknown aerial projectile\", the US military's Central Command said on Wednesday.\n\nSecurity firm Ambrey said it was the first time the Huthis had hit a ship using remote-controlled, water-borne explosives.\n\nIt was one of a surge of attacks this week, one of which badly injured a sailor who was evacuated by US forces from the MV Verbena in the Gulf of Aden on Thursday.\n\nThey follow the latest retaliatory strikes by US and British forces last month which killed 16 people, according to the Huthis, who threatened to escalate their activities.\n\n- 'Spy network' -\n\nOn Thursday, the United Nations special envoy Hans Grundberg warned of a slide back towards full-blown hostilities after a lull in Yemen's civil war.\n\n\"If the parties continue the current escalatory trajectory, the question is not if but when the parties revert to escalation on the battlefield,\" he told the UN Security Council in a briefing.\n\nApart from the Red Sea attacks, the Huthis this week arrested more than a dozen aid workers, including UN staff, accusing them of being part of a \"US-Israeli spy network\".\n\nUN human rights chief Volker Turk dismissed the \"outrageous allegations\" and demanded their immediate release.\n\nLast week, at least 18 combatants were killed in battles between the Huthis and Yemeni government forces in the country's southwest, two military officials told AFP.\n\nMeanwhile, a dispute between rival monetary authorities in rebel and government-controlled areas threatens to cut off banks in Sanaa from international transactions, further roiling Yemen's stricken economy.\n\nThe Huthis, who control much of Yemen, seized the capital Sanaa in 2014, prompting a Saudi-led military intervention in support of the government the following year.\n\nThey say their scores of Red Sea attacks since November are in support of Palestinians in Gaza as part of Iran's \"axis of resistance\" to the US and Israel.\n\nAmong the most notable attacks, the Huthis stormed and hijacked a vehicle-carrier, the Galaxy Leader, in November, later opening it as a tourist attraction for propaganda purposes.\n\nIn March, the Rubymar bulk carrier, carrying thousands of tonnes of fertiliser, sank in the Red Sea after its hull was damaged in a Huthi missile strike.\n\nYemen's war has left hundreds of thousands of people dead, through fighting or indirect causes such as disease or lack of food, with most of the population dependent on aid.\n\nth/kir\n\nFOX41 Yakima©FOX11 TriCities©",

The attack, part of a series of Huthi assaults, has disrupted vital maritime routes since the Israel-Hamas war began. The UK Maritime Trade Operations confirmed the crew's evacuation, with the Philippines President pledging support for Filipino seamen. This incident marks the first use of remote-controlled, water-borne explosives by the Huthis. The UN has warned of escalating hostilities in Yemen, with recent Huthi actions including the arrest of aid workers and attacks on other vessels. The conflict, ongoing since 2014, has severely impacted Yemen's economy and humanitarian situation.",

        "title": "G7 leaders tackle migration, AI and economic security on final day of summit",
        "body": "The G7 leaders stressed their determination to meet global challenges \"at a crucial moment in history\".\n\nThe gathering in a luxury resort in Italy's southern Puglia region also discussed other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, the war in Gaza, climate change, Iran, the situation in the Red Sea, gender equality and China's industrial policy and economic security.\n\n\"We are working together and with others to address the pressing challenges of our time,\" the G7 leaders said in a final statement, noting their solidarity with Ukraine, support for a deal that would lead to an immediate ceasefire and release of hostages in Gaza, investment in sustainable infrastructure in Africa and commitments to address climate change and migration.\n\nDivisions did emerge during the summit, however, notably over the lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final declaration.\n\nAsked if the G7 gathering has lived up to expectations, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"The aim of the G7 is to create convergence and be able to remove misunderstandings. It's not a place where you decide emergency measures or regulate things.\" He added that there were \"true convergences on Ukraine and Mideast\".\n\n\"It was a useful G7, with useful results,\" Mr Macron said. \"The coming weeks will create the conditions for political opportunities in particular around the two conflicts.\"\n\nMigration was the first topic of discussions on Friday, with the leaders mulling ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.\n\nThe issue is of particular interest to summit host Italy, which lies on one of the major routes into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her hardline stance on migration, has been eager to increase investment and funding for African nations as a means of reducing migratory pressure on Europe.\n\nThe leaders \"launched the G7 Coalition to prevent and counter the smuggling of migrants\", the summit's final declaration said, noting the seven nations would \"focus on the root causes of irregular migration, efforts to enhance border management and curb transnational organised crime, and safe and regular pathways for migration\".\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he and Ms Meloni - whom he described as \"fantastic\" - saw \"eye to eye\" on migration.\n\n\"We can't have criminal gangs decide who comes to our countries,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\nMs Meloni has a controversial five-year deal with neighbouring Albania for the Balkan country to host thousands of asylum seekers while Italy processes their claims. She has also spearheaded the \"Mattei Plan\" for Africa, a continent-wide strategy to increase economic opportunities at home and so discourage migration.\n\nFor its part, Britain has a deal to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, although no flights have yet taken off. Human rights organisations have criticised the agreement as unethical and unworkable.\n\nThe United States has also been struggling with a growing number of migrants. President Joe Biden introduced new policies to curb migration after a Bill he tried to get through Congress failed to pass. However, the future of the new policies is unclear after immigrant rights advocates challenged them with lawsuits.\n\nApart from the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, the Italian hosts also invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Ms Meloni's migration and development initiatives.\n\nBut rights groups decried what they said was a lack of ambition in support for developing countries.\n\nThe ONE Campaign, which advocates for investment in Africa, said it had found the G7 and EU institutions' share of aid going to Africa was at its lowest point since 1973.\n\n\"Without any concrete action, the G7 in Italy amounts to no more than pointless platitudes,\" said David McNair, executive director at The ONE Campaign.\n\nAlthough the summit's final statement \"reflects promises of increased partnership between the G7 and Africa, there are very few specifics on what new financing, if any, will be available\".\n\nPope Francis also became the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, delivering a speech on artificial intelligence. Other invitees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe summit opened on Thursday with a strong show of support for Kyiv: an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion-dollar (£39.5 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denounced the freezing of Russian assets as \"theft\" and vowed it \"will not go unpunished\".\n\nMr Biden also signed a bilateral security agreement with Mr Zelensky, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv.\n\nBut some cracks appeared among the G7 leaders, notably Mr Macron deploring a lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final document.\n\nThe statement after last year's summit in Hiroshima, Japan, expressed a commitment to provide access to safe and legal abortion to women and girls, and pledged to defend gender equality and the rights of members of the LGBT+ community.\n\nThe word \"abortion\" was absent from this year's final communique, although it included a reference to promoting sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\n\"It was not possible to reach agreement on these things in the room,\" a senior EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the private discussions.\n\nAsked on Thursday about reports that abortion would not be included in the final text, Mr Macron said it was something he regretted.\n\nFrance \"has included women's right to abortion, the freedom of decision on one's own body, into its constitution\", he said, adding that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men\".\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" Mr Macron said.\n\nMs Meloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has denied she is rolling back rights to abortions, which have been legal in Italy since 1978. But the centre-left opposition has warned that her initiatives are chipping away at those rights, including by giving pro-life groups access to women considering abortions.",

        "summary": "The G7 summit in Italy concluded with leaders addressing key global challenges, including migration, artificial intelligence, and economic security. The summit, held in Puglia, also covered financial support for Ukraine, the Gaza conflict, climate change, Iran, the Red Sea situation, gender equality, and China's industrial policy. The leaders expressed solidarity with Ukraine and support for a Gaza ceasefire and hostages' release. They launched a coalition to combat migrant smuggling and discussed investment in Africa to reduce migration pressures.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni emphasized investment in Africa to curb migration, aligning with UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on the issue. However, rights groups criticized the G7's support for developing countries as insufficient. Pope Francis addressed the summit on AI, and other notable attendees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.\n\nThe summit saw an agreement on a $50 billion loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets, which Russian President Vladimir Putin condemned. U.S. President Joe Biden signed a security agreement with Ukraine. However, divisions emerged, particularly over the absence of an abortion reference in the final declaration, which French President Emmanuel Macron regretted. The summit's outcomes highlighted both cooperation and contention among the G7 leaders.",

        "body": "The United States on Friday announced another $315 million for hungry Sudanese as it pressed the warring sides to end obstruction of aid, warning that a famine of historic proportions could unfold without urgent action.\n\nThe assistance will include food and drinking water, as well as malnutrition emergency screening and treatment for children.\n\nIt comes as estimates say that five million people inside Sudan suffer extreme hunger, with food lacking also in neighboring countries where two million Sudanese have fled.\n\n\"We need the world to wake up to the catastrophe happening before our very eyes,\" Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters.\n\n\"We've seen mortality projections estimating that in excess of 2.5 million people -- about 15 percent of the population -- in Darfur and Kordofan, the hardest-hit regions, could die by the end of September,\" she said.\n\n\"This is the largest humanitarian crisis on the face of the planet, and yet somehow it threatens to get worse,\" she said, pointing to expectations that the key border crossing will become unpassable with the rainy season.\n\nA UN humanitarian appeal for Sudan has received only 16 percent of its target, with much global attention focused instead on Gaza, where aid workers have also warned of famine risks.\n\nSamantha Power, the administrator of the US Agency for International Development (USAID), said Sudan could be in worse shape than Somalia in 2011 when some 250,000 people died after three consecutive seasons without enough rain in a country grappling with near anarchy.\n\n\"The most worrying scenario would be that Sudan would become the deadliest famine since Ethiopia in the early 1980s,\" when as many as 1.2 million people died, she said.\n\nSudan descended into war in April 2023 when the generals in charge of the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) took up arms to seize control, rejecting a plan to integrate.\n\nWith the two sides battling for power across the country, Power said that deliveries of aid across the rival sides' lines of control was \"virtually non-existent.\"\n\nPower strongly criticized both sides. The RSF, she said, has been \"systematically looting humanitarian warehouses, stealing food and livestock, destroying grain storage facilities and wells in the most vulnerable Sudanese communities.\"\n\nThe army, in turn \"completely contradicts its commitments and its responsibility\" to the Sudanese people by blocking aid from crossing the border with Chad into Darfur, she said.\n\n\"The really clear message here is that it is obstruction, not insufficient stocks of food, that is the driving force behind the historic and deadly levels of starvation in Sudan,\" she said.\n\n\"That has to change immediately.\"\n\n- Diplomacy struggles -\n\nRepeated US-led efforts to end the conflict have failed, with many observers concluding that the warring generals each think they can win on the ground.\n\nA number of foreign powers have supported rival forces. Sudan expelled diplomats from the United Arab Emirates on allegations of fueling the RSF, while Egypt, Turkey and Iran have backed the army.\n\nRecent fighting in El-Fasher, the last city in Darfur outside RSF control, has killed more than 220 people, according to charity Doctors Without Borders.\n\nThe UN Security Council on Thursday demanded that the RSF halt the siege, with all countries voting in favor except Russia, which abstained.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken late last month called Sudan's army chief, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and pressed both for humanitarian access and a resumption of diplomacy between the two sides.\n\nTalks last year in the Saudi port city of Jeddah, brokered by the United States and Saudi Arabia, only briefly paused fighting, and a US push to restart the process has been unsuccessful.\n\n\"We know that there is no acceptable military solution to this conflict,\" Thomas-Greenfield said.\n\n\"We have been disappointed with the delays.\"\n\nsct/st\n\nFOX41 Yakima©FOX11 TriCities©",

        "summary": "The United States has announced an additional $315 million in aid for Sudan to address severe hunger, warning of a potential historic famine if urgent action is not taken. The aid includes food, water, and emergency treatment for malnourished children. An estimated five million people in Sudan face extreme hunger, with two million refugees in neighboring countries also affected. US Ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, highlighted the dire situation, particularly in Darfur and Kordofan, where up to 2.5 million people could die by September. The conflict, which began in April 2023 between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), has severely hindered aid delivery. USAID Administrator Samantha Power criticized both sides for obstructing aid, with the RSF looting supplies and the army blocking aid routes. Diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict have failed, with foreign powers backing different factions. The UN Security Council has called for an end to the RSF siege in Darfur, but significant challenges remain.",

        "title": "G7 leaders tackle migration, AI and economic security on final day of summit",
        "body": "The G7 leaders stressed their determination to meet global challenges \"at a crucial moment in history\".\n\nThe gathering in a luxury resort in Italy's southern Puglia region also discussed other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, the war in Gaza, climate change, Iran, the situation in the Red Sea, gender equality and China's industrial policy and economic security.\n\n\"We are working together and with others to address the pressing challenges of our time,\" the G7 leaders said in a final statement, noting their solidarity with Ukraine, support for a deal that would lead to an immediate ceasefire and release of hostages in Gaza, investment in sustainable infrastructure in Africa and commitments to address climate change and migration.\n\nDivisions did emerge during the summit, however, notably over the lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final declaration.\n\nAsked if the G7 gathering has lived up to expectations, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"The aim of the G7 is to create convergence and be able to remove misunderstandings. It's not a place where you decide emergency measures or regulate things.\" He added that there were \"true convergences on Ukraine and Mideast\".\n\n\"It was a useful G7, with useful results,\" Mr Macron said. \"The coming weeks will create the conditions for political opportunities in particular around the two conflicts.\"\n\nMigration was the first topic of discussions on Friday, with the leaders mulling ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.\n\nThe issue is of particular interest to summit host Italy, which lies on one of the major routes into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her hardline stance on migration, has been eager to increase investment and funding for African nations as a means of reducing migratory pressure on Europe.\n\nThe leaders \"launched the G7 Coalition to prevent and counter the smuggling of migrants\", the summit's final declaration said, noting the seven nations would \"focus on the root causes of irregular migration, efforts to enhance border management and curb transnational organised crime, and safe and regular pathways for migration\".\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he and Ms Meloni - whom he described as \"fantastic\" - saw \"eye to eye\" on migration.\n\n\"We can't have criminal gangs decide who comes to our countries,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\nMs Meloni has a controversial five-year deal with neighbouring Albania for the Balkan country to host thousands of asylum seekers while Italy processes their claims. She has also spearheaded the \"Mattei Plan\" for Africa, a continent-wide strategy to increase economic opportunities at home and so discourage migration.\n\nFor its part, Britain has a deal to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, although no flights have yet taken off. Human rights organisations have criticised the agreement as unethical and unworkable.\n\nThe United States has also been struggling with a growing number of migrants. President Joe Biden introduced new policies to curb migration after a Bill he tried to get through Congress failed to pass. However, the future of the new policies is unclear after immigrant rights advocates challenged them with lawsuits.\n\nApart from the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, the Italian hosts also invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Ms Meloni's migration and development initiatives.\n\nBut rights groups decried what they said was a lack of ambition in support for developing countries.\n\nThe ONE Campaign, which advocates for investment in Africa, said it had found the G7 and EU institutions' share of aid going to Africa was at its lowest point since 1973.\n\n\"Without any concrete action, the G7 in Italy amounts to no more than pointless platitudes,\" said David McNair, executive director at The ONE Campaign.\n\nAlthough the summit's final statement \"reflects promises of increased partnership between the G7 and Africa, there are very few specifics on what new financing, if any, will be available\".\n\nPope Francis also became the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, delivering a speech on artificial intelligence. Other invitees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe summit opened on Thursday with a strong show of support for Kyiv: an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion-dollar (£39.5 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denounced the freezing of Russian assets as \"theft\" and vowed it \"will not go unpunished\".\n\nMr Biden also signed a bilateral security agreement with Mr Zelensky, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv.\n\nBut some cracks appeared among the G7 leaders, notably Mr Macron deploring a lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final document.\n\nThe statement after last year's summit in Hiroshima, Japan, expressed a commitment to provide access to safe and legal abortion to women and girls, and pledged to defend gender equality and the rights of members of the LGBT+ community.\n\nThe word \"abortion\" was absent from this year's final communique, although it included a reference to promoting sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\n\"It was not possible to reach agreement on these things in the room,\" a senior EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the private discussions.\n\nAsked on Thursday about reports that abortion would not be included in the final text, Mr Macron said it was something he regretted.\n\nFrance \"has included women's right to abortion, the freedom of decision on one's own body, into its constitution\", he said, adding that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men\".\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" Mr Macron said.\n\nMs Meloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has denied she is rolling back rights to abortions, which have been legal in Italy since 1978. But the centre-left opposition has warned that her initiatives are chipping away at those rights, including by giving pro-life groups access to women considering abortions.",

        "body": "The G7 leaders stressed their determination to meet global challenges \"at a crucial moment in history\".\n\nThe gathering in a luxury resort in Italy's southern Puglia region also discussed other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, the war in Gaza, climate change, Iran, the situation in the Red Sea, gender equality and China's industrial policy and economic security.\n\n\"We are working together and with others to address the pressing challenges of our time,\" the G7 leaders said in a final statement, noting their solidarity with Ukraine, support for a deal that would lead to an immediate ceasefire and release of hostages in Gaza, investment in sustainable infrastructure in Africa and commitments to address climate change and migration.\n\nDivisions did emerge during the summit, however, notably over the lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final declaration.\n\nAsked if the G7 gathering has lived up to expectations, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"The aim of the G7 is to create convergence and be able to remove misunderstandings. It's not a place where you decide emergency measures or regulate things.\" He added that there were \"true convergences on Ukraine and Mideast\".\n\n\"It was a useful G7, with useful results,\" Mr Macron said. \"The coming weeks will create the conditions for political opportunities in particular around the two conflicts.\"\n\nMigration was the first topic of discussions on Friday, with the leaders mulling ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.\n\nThe issue is of particular interest to summit host Italy, which lies on one of the major routes into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her hardline stance on migration, has been eager to increase investment and funding for African nations as a means of reducing migratory pressure on Europe.\n\nThe leaders \"launched the G7 Coalition to prevent and counter the smuggling of migrants\", the summit's final declaration said, noting the seven nations would \"focus on the root causes of irregular migration, efforts to enhance border management and curb transnational organised crime, and safe and regular pathways for migration\".\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he and Ms Meloni - whom he described as \"fantastic\" - saw \"eye to eye\" on migration.\n\n\"We can't have criminal gangs decide who comes to our countries,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\nMs Meloni has a controversial five-year deal with neighbouring Albania for the Balkan country to host thousands of asylum seekers while Italy processes their claims. She has also spearheaded the \"Mattei Plan\" for Africa, a continent-wide strategy to increase economic opportunities at home and so discourage migration.\n\nFor its part, Britain has a deal to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, although no flights have yet taken off. Human rights organisations have criticised the agreement as unethical and unworkable.\n\nThe United States has also been struggling with a growing number of migrants. President Joe Biden introduced new policies to curb migration after a Bill he tried to get through Congress failed to pass. However, the future of the new policies is unclear after immigrant rights advocates challenged them with lawsuits.\n\nApart from the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, the Italian hosts also invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Ms Meloni's migration and development initiatives.\n\nBut rights groups decried what they said was a lack of ambition in support for developing countries.\n\nThe ONE Campaign, which advocates for investment in Africa, said it had found the G7 and EU institutions' share of aid going to Africa was at its lowest point since 1973.\n\n\"Without any concrete action, the G7 in Italy amounts to no more than pointless platitudes,\" said David McNair, executive director at The ONE Campaign.\n\nAlthough the summit's final statement \"reflects promises of increased partnership between the G7 and Africa, there are very few specifics on what new financing, if any, will be available\".\n\nPope Francis also became the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, delivering a speech on artificial intelligence. Other invitees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe summit opened on Thursday with a strong show of support for Kyiv: an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion-dollar (£39.5 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denounced the freezing of Russian assets as \"theft\" and vowed it \"will not go unpunished\".\n\nMr Biden also signed a bilateral security agreement with Mr Zelensky, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv.\n\nBut some cracks appeared among the G7 leaders, notably Mr Macron deploring a lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final document.\n\nThe statement after last year's summit in Hiroshima, Japan, expressed a commitment to provide access to safe and legal abortion to women and girls, and pledged to defend gender equality and the rights of members of the LGBT+ community.\n\nThe word \"abortion\" was absent from this year's final communique, although it included a reference to promoting sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\n\"It was not possible to reach agreement on these things in the room,\" a senior EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the private discussions.\n\nAsked on Thursday about reports that abortion would not be included in the final text, Mr Macron said it was something he regretted.\n\nFrance \"has included women's right to abortion, the freedom of decision on one's own body, into its constitution\", he said, adding that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men\".\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" Mr Macron said.\n\nMs Meloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has denied she is rolling back rights to abortions, which have been legal in Italy since 1978. But the centre-left opposition has warned that her initiatives are chipping away at those rights, including by giving pro-life groups access to women considering abortions.",

        "summary": "The G7 summit in Italy concluded with leaders addressing key global issues such as migration, artificial intelligence, economic security, and financial support for Ukraine. The leaders emphasized their solidarity with Ukraine, support for a ceasefire in Gaza, investment in African infrastructure, and commitments to climate change and migration. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her strict migration policies, pushed for increased investment in Africa to reduce migratory pressures. The G7 launched a coalition to combat migrant smuggling and discussed enhancing border management.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron noted the summit's role in fostering convergence rather than immediate action, highlighting agreements on Ukraine and the Middle East. However, divisions emerged, particularly over the absence of a reference to abortion in the final declaration, a point of contention for Macron.\n\nThe summit also saw participation from African leaders and other global figures, including Pope Francis, who spoke on artificial intelligence. The G7 supported a $50 billion loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets, a move condemned by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Despite some disagreements, the summit aimed to address pressing global challenges and foster international cooperation.",

Other invitees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe summit opened on Thursday with a strong show of support for Kyiv: an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion-dollar (£39.5 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denounced the freezing of Russian assets as \"theft\" and vowed it \"will not go unpunished\".\n\nMr Biden also signed a bilateral security agreement with Mr Zelensky, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv.\n\nBut some cracks appeared among the G7 leaders, notably Mr Macron deploring a lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final document.\n\nThe statement after last year's summit in Hiroshima, Japan, expressed a commitment to provide access to safe and legal abortion to women and girls, and pledged to defend gender equality and the rights of members of the LGBT+ community.\n\nThe word \"abortion\" was absent from this year's final communique, although it included a reference to promoting sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\n\"It was not possible to reach agreement on these things in the room,\" a senior EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the private discussions.\n\nAsked on Thursday about reports that abortion would not be included in the final text, Mr Macron said it was something he regretted.\n\nFrance \"has included women's right to abortion, the freedom of decision on one's own body, into its constitution\", he said, adding that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men\".\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" Mr Macron said.\n\nMs Meloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has denied she is rolling back rights to abortions, which have been legal in Italy since 1978. But the centre-left opposition has warned that her initiatives are chipping away at those rights, including by giving pro-life groups access to women considering abortions.",

        "summary": "The G7 summit in Italy concluded with leaders addressing key global issues such as migration, artificial intelligence, economic security, and financial support for Ukraine. The leaders emphasized solidarity with Ukraine, support for a Gaza ceasefire, investment in African infrastructure, and commitments to climate change and migration. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her strict migration policies, pushed for increased investment in Africa to reduce migratory pressures. The G7 launched a coalition to combat migrant smuggling and discussed enhancing border management.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron noted the summit's role in fostering convergence rather than immediate action, highlighting agreements on Ukraine and the Middle East. However, divisions emerged, particularly over the absence of a reference to abortion in the final declaration, a point of contention for Macron.\n\nThe summit also saw participation from African leaders and other global figures, including Pope Francis, who spoke on AI, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The G7 agreed on a $50 billion loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets, which Russian President Vladimir Putin condemned. Despite some progress, rights groups criticized the summit for lacking concrete support for developing countries.",

        "body": "The deal, which parties referred to as a government of national unity, will bring the ANC together in government with the Democratic Alliance (DA), a white-led party that had for years been the main opposition and a fierce foe for the ANC.\n\nAt least two other smaller parties will also be part of the agreement that put South Africa into uncharted waters with the first national coalition government in its democratic history.\n\n\"The government of national unity is on track,\" ANC secretary-general Fikile Mbalula said. \"For the interest of the country, we said let's work together. We have no fear of that.\"\n\nThe agreement was necessary after the ANC lost its 30-year majority in a humbling national election for it last month. It was a turning point for Africa's most industrialised economy. The ANC is the party of Nelson Mandela and had governed with a comfortable majority ever since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994.\n\nThat three-decade dominance ended in the May 29 election, when the ANC's share of the vote dropped to 40% amid discontent from South Africans over high levels of poverty, inequality and unemployment.\n\nAll the parties have said they would put their differences aside to work in the best interests of the country.\n\nHowever, analysts warned there might be complications ahead given the starkly different ideologies of the ANC, a former liberation movement, and the centrist, business-friendly DA -- the two biggest parties and the key players. The DA won 21% of the vote in the national election, the second largest share.\n\nFor one, the DA disagreed with the ANC government's move to accuse Israel of genocide in Gaza in a highly sensitive case at the United Nations' top court.\n\nDA leader John Steenhuisen was the first to confirm that an agreement was dramatically signed on Friday when Parliament was in a break.\n\n\"From today, the DA will co-govern the Republic of South Africa in a spirit of unity and collaboration,\" Mr Steenhuisen said as he broke away from the proceedings to make a speech that was carried live on television. He called it an \"historic step forward.\"\n\nMr Steenhuisen said the DA would back the 71-year-old Mr Ramaphosa for president and because the two parties have a clear joint majority of seats in Parliament, Mr Ramaphosa's re-election now appeared to be assured.\n\nThe Parliament session first went through the hours-long swearing-in of hundreds of new MPs and electing a speaker and a deputy speaker, before the house set to vote on the president, well into the night. Two candidates were nominated -- Mr Ramaphosa and Julius Malema, the leader of the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters party which had refused to join the unity government.\n\nA majority of the votes cast in a secret ballot in the 400-member lower house of Parliament, called the National Assembly, was required to elect a president.\n\nFormer President Jacob Zuma's MK Party was boycotting the session, which did not after the voting as only a third of the house is needed for a quorum.\n\nParliament convened in an unusual setting after a fire in 2022 gutted the National Assembly building in Cape Town and lawmakers came together at a conference centre near the city's waterfront.\n\nTwo other smaller parties said they would be part of the coalition agreement and Mr Mbalula said the ANC was open to talking with anyone else who wanted to join the unity government.\n\nThere are 18 political parties represented in Parliament and Mr Mbalula said the multi-party agreement would \"prioritise the country across the political and ideological divide\". Some parties refused to join.\n\nThe other two parties to join were the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Patriotic Alliance, which has drawn attention because of its strong anti-immigration stance and because its leader, Gayton McKenzie, served a prison sentence for bank robbery.\n\n\"The deal is we are putting South Africa first,\" Mr McKenzie said in an interview on state broadcaster SABC. \"We are going to work together. We have decided we are not going to let South Africa die in our hands, on our watch.\"\n\nThe ANC had faced a deadline to get a coalition agreement given parliament had to sit for the first time and vote for the president within 14 days of the election results being declared on June 2.\n\nThe ANC had been trying to strike a coalition agreement for two weeks and the final negotiations went through the night Thursday and into Friday, party officials said.\n\nSouth Africa had not faced this level of political uncertainty since the ANC swept to power in the first all-race election in 1994 that ended nearly a half-century of racial segregation.\n\nThe party had held a clear majority in parliament since then, meaning parliamentary votes for the president were formalities and every South African leader since had been from the ANC, starting with Mr Mandela.\n\nThis unity government also harked back to the way Mr Mandela, South Africa's first black president, invited political opponents to be part of a new unity government in 1994 in an act of reconciliation. The ANC's hand was forced this time.\n\n\"The ANC has been very magnanimous in that they have accepted defeat and have said, 'let's talk',\" PA leader Mr McKenzie said.",

        "title": "Max Blumenthal: The Washington Post's Attack on The Grayzone - Russia News Now",
        "body": "Everyday the Washington Post's \"democracy dies in darkness\" grows evermore ironic and detached from the reality of what the publication -- and legacy media as a whole -- has become. In the latest clash between independent and mainstream press, one of the country's largest remaining newspapers accused -- and then retracted -- a claim that The Grayzone had received payments from the Iranian media.\n\nThe Grayzone editor-in-chief, Max Blumenthal, joins host Robert Scheer on this episode of Scheer Intelligence to discuss the attack on the publication and its dark implications for the future of media.\n\nBlumenthal explains how publications like the Post produce articles like this in response to the factual yet inconvenient reporting of outlets like The Grayzone:\n\n\"This is what passes for journalism in the Washington Post. That in itself should be a scandal but what has happened is everyone who hates us, who wants to take us down because of our factual journalism, especially Zionists, the pro-Israel lobby, has taken this article and declared matter of factly without any evidence that The Grayzone is funded by Iran and Russia.\"\n\nWith the surge in intelligence officials populating corporate media shows and frequently serving as anonymous sources in reports of global events such as the war in Gaza, the war in Ukraine and other affairs, it comes as no surprise that attacks like this latest one on The Grayzone happen.\n\nBlumenthal reflects on the media's self awareness of their downfall, noting that their audience is thinning and independent media rightly and honorably serves as a threat. \"They have put a target on my back. They can't control me, they can't control so many independent outlets I can think of and at the same time, their own audience is bleeding.\"\n\nThis transcript was produced by an automated transcription service. Please refer to the audio interview to ensure accuracy.\n\nRobert Scheer: Hi, this is Robert Scheer with another edition of Scheer Intelligence, and I'm having a guest back, Max Blumenthal, the editor, publisher, whatever, I don't remember, probably both, of The Greyzone. I consider it an incredibly vital publication, read it all the time, and cribbed from it from my own Scheer Post. And, I've been an admirer of his work. Actually, I knew him as a kid because his father was at the Washington Post, which is germane to our subject here. His mother was in charge of White House fellows and the Clinton administration. And then he's gone on to, I think, have a great career, wrote a very important book about Israel.\n\nI thought it was a very gutsy book. And at the time, Thought, wow, it's pretty controversial, but now it looks pretty lame, actually. the U. N. is way ahead of you, at least the U. N. courts. And, I don't think you alleged any genocide up to that point. I may be wrong. I haven't grabbed my copy off the bookshelf.\n\nBut the reason I wanted to have you here is I'm, I don't want to say I'm freaked out, because sometimes I think it's a comedy show and then sometimes I'm very alarmed. And what's happened to what is legacy media? It's not really legacy media because it's not even owned by the same people that owned it.\n\nI knew K. Graham at the Washington Post, for example, huh? Otis Chandler, the owner of the L. A. Times, I worked for him for 29 years. but now, the Washington Post is a different beast. It's owned by one of the richest, maybe the richest, the second richest person in the world, Jeff Bezos. it just fired its editor.\n\nI'm not quite sure. She wasn't willing to make the cuts they wanted to make. and, but they went after you. And your, Wyatt Reed, your top editor, at Grayzone, in a way that I don't recall any major publication would have ever done in the worst days of the Cold War and McCarthyism or anything else.\n\nit really, I have to say, was unseemly is the word I would use. and, it's hard to do red baiting because they always want to drag Russia into it. And it's now run by. A guy who denounced communism and defeats the Communist Party in elections and so forth. I don't know what the right word is.\n\nIt's fear mongering, certainly. And, it's an attempt to destroy freedom of the press. I kept thinking when I was reading the book. The article about you and then reading your rejoinder, which we did post on ScheerPost, I think about Tom Paine, for God's sake, you think of Tom Paine as this great defender of free speech, free press and so forth.\n\nAnd, even at his, in his day, people said he was an agent of the French or agent of someone else, but they didn't go so far as to say. He shouldn't have any free speech rights. In fact, they enshrined the free speech rights of folks like Tom Paine and our Constitution, whether they like what they had to say or not.\n\nI'm taking too much time for this introduction. Tell the people who haven't read your Rejoined or read the Washington Post article, which had to retract its opening, sentence. But why don't you just take it over now? And explain what this happened. And I know for you, it's not a joke. And for free press, it's not a joke, but I guess it's the theater of the absurd.\n\nI, just don't even get what's happened, to, to our so called mainstream media. And by the way, it's the main media. A lot of people read because it's what, Apple News. features. They go, they even have news week up there in time magazine and every day, every morning I'm greeted to Apple news and it's all, it's publication.\n\nI didn't even know who owns these anymore. So tell me about the Washington post and, their attack on you and your publication and on why read\n\nMax Blumenthal: well, This was in the Washington post full page, essentially arguing without any facts or any, argument that we should be criminalized, possibly jailed. The hook of the article.\n\nIs that Wyatt Reed who I made managing editor. I don't even know what that means. It was just, like a title. I don't know what it entails. Why it does editing for me. And he writes articles, and sometimes appears on our live stream to do analysis. Four years ago, he publicly did some production and appearances on press TV.\n\nPress TV is, a great show. It's an Iranian state backed international broadcaster that performs the same role as like the BBC or Al Jazeera. And he said that he was a producer for Press TV on his Twitter bio. This is not something he hid. I don't know what the facts of his arrangement were, what the details were with them, but you would assume if someone's doing production for them and he was like covering things like Black Lives Matter protests and fairly mundane stuff.\n\nHe was also covering them getting fees from CBS News, notorious enemy of the state, CBS News for his coverage of Black Lives Matter. He was just out there, start launching a journalistic career independently. And he had no. Involvement with the gray zone, except that we would hang out together.\n\nSometimes he wasn't on staff. And so that's all they have in this Washington Post article. And with that, basically, they got these hack documents somehow, which, according to the hack documents show, Wyatt Reed got some chump change for his work for press TV. They first alleged that Wyatt violated U. S.\n\nsanctions and therefore should be criminally punished. But they also tried to tie it to the gray zone. Somehow, because we have been busting Israel's propaganda, and to try to create the sense that Iran is actually influencing us and even paying us, along with Russia. Which they present no evidence for and that's why we're a criminal outlet, the use, the author who's the head of the digital threat section at the Washington Post.\n\nWe've been classified as a digital threat at the great. This is\n\nScheer: Is that actually, a title? It's not a masthead title. Is it a title at a newspaper?\n\nBlumenthal: He said, I'm the digital threats editor at the Washington Post. He approached Wyatt Reed by email and demanded to speak to his lawyer.\n\nThat's how he approached him and accused him of violating U. S. sanctions in all sorts of ways, violating U. S. law in all sorts of ways. I've never seen anything like that from another journalist. And it really speaks to the hostility that legacy media, which is itself is. A conduit for U. S. Intelligence has for us.\n\nit this article clearly was related to our reporting and, the investigations we've done on Israel's lies about October 7th. He mentions it repeatedly in the piece, falsely accuses us of misinformation, then says that there's some kind of overlap in funding between Wyatt Reed and the Gray Zone, which makes no sense, that election season misinformation is a plague and a menace, even though nothing we've written has anything to do with the U.\n\nS. election. Nor is it misinformation and uses words like the complexity of misinformation. There's a caption underneath a photo of Vladimir Putin at the top of the article, which says that Russia is seeking new ways to influence Americans, insinuating that the gray zone is one of those ways, even though there's no.\n\nEvidence provided at all in the article. And let's just state Russia and Iran do not support fund the gray zone. So what is the point of this article? it's obviously that the three letter agencies are after us. They can't discredit us. They see that our audience is growing while the audience of the Washington Post has shrunk by 50% in the past year, and now they're just seeking to finesse some kind of federal investigation.\n\nIf you look at. Every source in this Washington Post article, those quoted by the demonstrably mendacious author Joseph Men, they're all funded by the U. S. government and their intelligence fronts, like the Atlantic Council Digital Forensic Research Lab, which is also funded by the United Arab Emirates, kind of adversary of Iran.\n\nAustralian Strategic and Policy Institute. is quoted there about the Solomon Islands. We've never written about the Solomon Islands. It's just like a complete non sequitur. But ASPI, this think tank that I just mentioned is also funded by the U. S. government and by arms manufacturers that are making tons of money off the Ukraine proxy war and off U.\n\nS. military aid to Israel. Same with the Atlantic Council. The guy who got these, hack documents from about press TV is. A bizarre internet troll who has been described in his own emails and by others as an FBI informant. His name is Neil Rauhauser. Just a bizarre character. And down the line, in other words, every source is sponsored by the US government or a foreign government and they're falsely accusing us of being government backed when we're not.\n\nAnd this is what passes for journalism in the Washington Post. That in itself should be a scandal but what has happened is everyone who hates us, who wants to take us down because of our factual journalism, especially Zionists, the pro-Israel lobby, has taken this article and declared matter of factly without any evidence that The Grayzone is funded by Iran and Russia.\n\nthat was the headline in Israel's I 24 and they just state that without any evidence.\n\nScheer: Can you sue over that?\n\nBlumenthal: I'd have to go to Israel to sue them, and I don't think I'll be allowed into Israel at this point. Yeah,\n\nScheer: I just was curious, because I always say it's, bizarre, it's not even a dark comedy, it's a stupid comedy, except this is how you destroy freedom.\n\nYeah, and that's what they're doing. Yeah, it was pointed out, by Charlie Chaplin was a comic figure until he wasn't a comic figure. And there's a way of looking, look, first of all, I'm, deadly opposed to any ad hominem attacks on, on any story because you have to look at the story, see what they came up with.\n\nAnd I don't care whatever they did in their other life, the journalist or the writer, you judge it by its information. And so I personally. some of my best friends have worked for the CIA and, the Voice of America and so forth. And I didn't ever say, okay, I'm not going to believe anything they tell me or analyze what they write or so forth.\n\nHere, I'm not even sure what the crime is that this Wyatt Reed did, before he joined you. Because what was wrong with, doing some work for the Iranian media? or for RT or something or anybody, or for Voice of America. the point is what kind of journalism, what is that? Does it hold up?\n\nDoes it work? is it dishonest? And so we've lost the idea of attacking the, like your book. I brought up your book because I'd like to know people to tell me Max Blumenthal, blah, blah, blah. I said, where's the book? What's wrong with the book? The book is a really solid piece of reporting, not a piece, it's a book and it's real and what take issue with it or don't take issue with.\n\nSo the argument is shift now. That's why I bring up McCarthy. I bring up this baiting and so forth. cause I read the Washington Post article. There was in a single thing that the gray zone is supposed to have done wrong journalistically. and so the ad hominem attack is the basis of the whole thing.\n\nAnd even not just that hominem.\n\nBlumenthal: They're accusing us of, committing crimes of violating U S sanctions. And they say so openly, that, what, since 2013, there've been these sanctions on Iran and therefore anyone who's done work for press TV, who's an American could and should be jailed. And that could be hundreds of people.\n\nthere have been no such sanctions like that vis a vis Russia. but hundreds and hundreds of Americans, prominent people have had, gigs at RT because it was one of the only places, one of the only international broadcasters where Americans could say certain things that were critical of U. S.\n\nforeign policy. you can't say it in the Washington Post. That's why so many young journalists, who now work completely independently with no foreign backing at all. contributing to the gray zone had, worked in the past at places like RT or Sputnik because it's the only place they could have worked where they in, all of us media.\n\nin all of it, because progressive us media, like the, nation, for example, or truth dig, they were hijacked and wound up supporting phony, intelligence hoaxes like Russiagate, or supported the U S dirty war in Syria or support the proxy war in Ukraine. So this is like this, this is just, it's just clear.\n\nScheer: I know, but I think the\n\nBlumenthal: author of this piece knows that they're just trying to silence us because of the work we've been doing to expose those wars. And that independent media is just taking on a more powerful role than it ever has. And the public trusts us more than the Washington Post.\n\nScheer: Okay, but I want to get at the heart of what I do think is the real danger here.\n\nthere, with what is now, what is called legacy media, and as I say, like your father, I worked for legacy media. I've worked for the LA Times for 29 years, and there were certain rules of disclosure, not always followed, and not always perfect, but there was certain understanding. And I think at the heart of it is, a work of art.\n\nJournalism, politics, or anything else should be criticized, evaluated on its own merits. And that smearing, ad hominem attack, bringing up the personality, bringing up background, and so forth, should be irrelevant. I know I'm one of the first people to publish Cy Hirsch when I edited Ramparts magazine.\n\nAnd even in that day, the New York Times ran our stories that we had on Vietnam because they held up. They were factually accurate, they couldn't be disproved, and we were breaking news. What's happened now is because the news is uncomfortable. The truth is uncomfortable. We actually have to consider maybe U.\n\nS. policy is fundamentally wrong in basic ways. Maybe the world is more complex and so forth. So instead of challenging what you put in your book. And, or what you have on, on, on Grayzone, they're going after this innuendo, this ad hominem attack. I keep bringing this up, and it's illogical in terms of the pursuit of truth for journalism.\n\nIt's just irrational. And the fact is, as you point out, the Grayzone did excellent reporting on the, horror, yes, I'll say, of, what happened in Israel and that first day that's triggered this off. But the narrative was spun. by the Israeli government distorted, false information was offered, and they've had to back off on it.\n\nAnd so you had the courage to call him out. That's what journalists are supposed to do, whether it's Max Blumenthal or Tom Paine. That's what he did, and when we still had a First Amendment, even though Tom Paine could be a terrible irritant, and some people thought he was a traitor, they still protected Tom Paine, probably was the person to have most in mind.\n\nWhen they, insisted on the First Amendment to people who were resisting a constitution without that protection. So I want to get to the heart of the matter here, and that's the use of this idea of establishment journalism, and who gets to define what misinformation is. the New York Times once again has disgraced itself on this very incident of, of the rapes and so forth that were claimed politically motivated, directed by Hamas, and yet their reporter is still reporting.\n\nand the question is really, who gets to decide what's misinformation and, as I say, in the case of, it's not even legacy journalism because it's not the same folks who used to own these papers who were primarily were concerned about keeping the loyalty of their readers and being honest with their readers.\n\nThere was a market. That's why I ended up working at the LA Times because Otis Chandler wanted to convince people out there it was not just the right publication that you could have progressive journalists who could also do good journalism. And what's happening here is a lot of good journalism is done by the gray zone.\n\nIt's it's done by, the intercept by a lot of people, much more, much, much more than what's called traditional journalism. That's really what they're going after. They want to claim the narrative and deny anyone, the right to present an alternative view. Isn't that really what's going on?\n\nBlumenthal: Yeah, at the dawn of the Trump era, we saw the birth of this counter disinformation industry, what I would call and what others call the censorship industrial complex. And the intelligence agencies, the FBI basically laundered it. It's or concealed its fingerprints behind a series of think tanks like the Alliance for Securing Democracy, which was run out of the German Marshall Fund and created this phony Russian bot tracker called Hamilton 68, which was exposed as just completely fake first by us or by me when I was writing for alternate.\n\nthe Twitter files showed that even Twitter. executives knew that it was fake and that they had no, they couldn't produce any data. But the whole point is to declare anything that contravenes the objectives of the U. S. imperial regime to be misinformation, malinformation or disinformation or something in between.\n\nAnd that's what they did in this Washington Post article, Joseph Men. He accused us of For my reporting in October that Israel killed its own citizens, many of its own citizens on October 7th. That's been confirmed in a UN report. That was released yesterday, an independent United Nations report confirmed that Israel enacted the Hannibal Directive on a mass scale, killed its own citizens, knowing that they would die with tank shells and Apache helicopters after they had been taken captive by Hamas militants.\n\nThis is something that I knew Israel did before, and I compiled evidence that they had done it along with testimony by Apache helicopter pilots. And, I've been proven right. Israeli media has reported on it, but this Washington Post reporter accuses us of misinformation for me reporting that, and his source is just Israelis.\n\nHe say, Israelis say that Max Blumenthal distorted the truth about October 7th. the greatest propagator of misinformation, as we know, Bob, legacy corporate. Media outlets like the Washington Post, and they're doing it with us. That's why no one should take this article seriously, along with the fact that they never produced the evidence that we're some foreign intelligence weapon.\n\nScheer: But we don't have the choice of taking it seriously because the way media is constructed now, it's not a bond between reader who Plunks down 10 cents or a quarter to buy a paper. They can trust the New York Daily News or the New York Times or the Daily Worker or any other lefty or right wing publication.\n\nYou now have this, it's bizarre. Apple, I thought it was going to be, AOL was going to control. They disappeared. You have something like Apple or Google News. And, The internet, and I've seen it because I've been doing, publishing or writing on it now for some 20 years, used to be pretty open and it was a fresh breath, breath of fresh air for democracy.\n\nReaders could find you and then they could support you. They could send money, Like they do to gray zone, they could submit money like they do to share posts or like they do to NPR at which this hopefully this will be broadcast on. but the fact of the matter is that's not what happens now. What happens is the internet is no longer free and open.\n\nIt's tightly controlled and, the people who like, for instance, what we're doing now, the people who will know about it, hear about it, is very limited. So there will be a crowd that will find it, but very often it's accidental. People basically write letters all the time. God, I found you. Why should it be so hard to find me?\n\nit wasn't 15 years ago. You wrote something interesting. People were reading it. They pass it around. So talk about that a little bit. And also before we run out of time, I just got a notice from the intercept as a reader or subscriber, and it said that now organizations like that can lose their tax exempt status because of the new rules that are being passed by Congress.\n\nI don't know if you want to go into that, but what, I, really want to talk about is how. This, the idea that the internet, the positive thing about the internet, it was, relatively wide open. It's been shut down tighter than a drum.\n\nBlumenthal: there, there was a point when the Grayzone's YouTube channel was exploding and on or around May 15th, 2020, it exploded.\n\nStopped and we are our subscribers started to come in with a trickle, even though we had 100, 000 of them. What happened on May 15th, 2020. we analyzed the data. That's when a pandemic was declared and new rules came in, putting the clamp down on anyone, any site that was being publishing that wasn't controlled, that wasn't corporate media that could possibly say something that was slightly out of the ordinary, whether it related to COVID or foreign policy.\n\nAnd the point was to make us make it harder to find us. If you watch like a gray zone video, like a clip from one of our live streams on YouTube, you'll immediately be taken somewhere else. After the gray zone video away from the gray zone channel on Google, if you're in the United States on a, IP address in the U S it's very difficult to find our articles.\n\nIf you Google them, if you're like in Central America, it's much easier because the algorithm is different. mechanisms have been put in place to make it hard to find us or to, find sheer post, but it's still not possible to control and. Suppress our influence like our live streams at the gray zone since October 7th have been getting continuously over 10, 000 views, which means over a hundred thousand views despite all of this repression suppression.\n\nAnd that's, if I was just some guy in a bar saying that Israel is pulling all of these hoaxes about mass sexual violence on October 7th, and I was clinically dissecting phony New York Times articles about it before people at the bar. Then no one would care what I had to say. I wouldn't have to be attacked, but I have a 20 year record of writing books, doing documentaries, and amassing an audience going across the country again and again, speaking to public audiences and gaining the credibility that I think I deserve.\n\nto analyze these issues. And so they have put a target on my back. They can't control me, they can't control so many independent outlets I can think of. And at the same time, their own audience is bleeding. Sally Busby, executive editor of the Washington Post had to resign in disgrace abruptly last week. They're completely restructuring the Washington Post because they have no idea. What do you\n\nScheer: mean she resigned in disgrace?\n\nBlumenthal: The publisher gathered all the employees. This is reported in Vanity Fair two Mondays ago.\n\nBlumenthal: forced to resign. she's basically fired. And he said, we have lost 50 percent of our audience in the past year. Nobody is reading us anymore. And out of nowhere, the executive editor resigns. They're going to create like a third, A third kind of Washington Post newsroom which focuses on social media storytelling because no one reads their articles anymore.\n\nNo one even watches their videos. And what they refuse to acknowledge is that people are sick of them just serving as stenographers for power, pushing Zionism, pushing big tech propaganda down people's throats and doing the kind of attacks that they did on us. While people are turning, people. Who are highly politically educated, extremely motivated, believe in social justice, want to affect political change, are sick of the two parties, their geriatric war like bought off leadership, which is more and more Americans.\n\nAre, turning to us, and more Americans trust comedians than they do politicians at this point. There have been poll, there's been poll after poll showing that. So we're looking at a complete crisis of confidence in the American establishment from right from left across all ages. And so we're the targets and they have failed to control us.\n\nThey have failed to, convince the public that we're evil. And so the only thing left for them to do is to do what they did to Julian Assange, which is to try to, see us into a prison cell somewhere and lock us away and then scare everybody else, crucify us in the town square so that everybody else gets so afraid that they won't do what we did.\n\nEven though what we do is completely. legal within the realm of the first amendment and ethical within what I understand to be journalistic practice. What they do is something else. and they don't do a disclosure. Bob, like Gregg Jaffe, Washington Post, national security reporter. He's a simultaneously a fellow at the center for new American security.\n\nWhat is that? It's the Democrats version of the law. Project for a New American Century. It's funded by the U. S. government, by the State Department, by the Pentagon, and by the arms manufacturers. You think that guy's gonna, you think that guy's gonna challenge, bite the hand that feeds him? I don't think so.\n\nScheer: but speaking of the hand that feeds him, it's ultimately Jeff Bezos. Oh, yeah. Who actually used his own personal money, didn't even have to use Amazon. To buy the Washington Post and it's interesting because what did he\n\nBlumenthal: do? Sorry to interrupt, but what did he do a few days after buying the post? He inked a deal with the CIA to host their cloud at Amazon for 600 million.\n\nScheer: That's exactly the point I was going to make, but, thanks for beating me to it. I have to give way to younger people here, but, it's not just the, cloud. the fact is that, Google, Amazon, These companies are deeply entwined with the military industrial complex that General Eisenhower turned president warned us about in his farewell address.\n\nThey don't even teach that in schools anymore, make much comment about it, but this idea of our having a war driven economy. Needing, therefore, not to, prevent peace between, in Ukraine and Russia, or to prevent ultimately any solution that would acknowledge the rights of Palestinians to full human rights.\n\nThey actually benefit from this state of conflict in the world. and, exploiting it. And, the interesting thing, I don't think if they can silence you, they can silence me, there still will be good journalists writing good stories. The Times of London had a very good story on the very subject that you're talking about, the whole rape thing just yesterday.\n\nThere are other people will do it. The point is they won't have careers for long. That really, you have to go to the question of the ownership of media. I promised you I'd let you go, after 30 minutes, so I'll cut it off. But I, just, what's really disturbing here is the illusion of a free press. And, I've been at this a long time, 60 years or something or more.\n\nAnd, I've never seen a worse situation because it's deceptive, it's, like people don't even know, you, oh, this is Newsweek, this is Time, no it isn't, it's something different, it went through bankruptcy or change or different owners, and no, your Washington Post is not the, sweat and blood of, Phil Graham and, and others, it's, no, it's, a toy, something different.\n\nOver Jeff Bezos, right? I don't know. Yeah,\n\nBlumenthal: it's not just that it's the toy of Jeff Bezos. It's that, as you pointed out, it supports a particular culture of journalists and spits out anyone who understands the world From a non imperialist perspective or is not willing to cultivate, to be an access journalist and focus on cultivating sources within the three letter agencies and the military and serve as their stenographer.\n\nthey ultimately cannot last. And then where do they work? Where is there to work in the United States? It's the perfect propaganda model. It's there's nowhere for you to work or to be heard. Except R. T. And now R. T. can't even operate inside the United States as far as I know. and if you work for them, you can never work again because the Washington Post will brand you persona non grata and speculate on whether you should be jailed.\n\nScheer: Let me just conclude this though, but it's interesting. I start each morning, reading the South China Morning Post, which is owned by Alibaba, a, capitalist enterprise in China. They're learning, the Chinese, I think, are learning there's a much more efficient form of totalitarianism. This was the argument between Orwell and Huxley, and Huxley said, no, it doesn't need the boot all the time.\n\nIt can be done through seduction, control. and, I see it, I read, actually they have articles that are, it's English language, it's gamed in Hong Kong, but it's worldwide available. They have some criticism, they have some, people learn to play this game throughout the world. The fact of the matter is, And I want to go to the end just with that word, a non imperial, because we were all raised to never think of the United States as possibly imperialistic, even though objectively looking at its number of bases and its power and its influence and control, there's no question.\n\nbut the real information that they want to suppress, it is the notion of American innocence, that they wanted to assert. That's really, I, as I see it, at the heart of this whole thing. And here, Biden and Trump are joined at the hip, or when Trump said, he's gonna make America great, and Hillary Clinton said, America's always been great.\n\nAnd the idea that this country can make mistakes, but not do anything fundamentally wrong, is the big issue in the world right now. Whether it's coming from India, Brazil, South Africa, people are objecting. to that control of the narrative, and they're saying, no, that's what we mean by a multipolar world.\n\nThey're saying we are actors in this world. We get to weigh in. That's what the UN is doing, pushing back. And I think that is really the issue. It's not, a non imperialist view. It's any idea of challenging the virtue of American supremacy.\n\nBlumenthal: Yeah, I was attacked in the, the, mainstream media attacks on me really started around Syria.\n\nthis, shouldn't have even concerned the United States, but the way that the United States wages war and exerts its imperial influences often through proxies now, so that can do so without. Having its, being held accountable the same way that it was with what it did in Iraq, which is a purely American operation that decimated a country destabilized an entire swath of the globe.\n\nIn Syria, the U. S. Was using. Jihadist death squads that it would arm covertly or semi covertly, and then it had this, White Helmets operation of so called rescuers who would pump out propaganda from the ground and accuse the Syrian government of chemical attacks, and I played a seminal role, along with many others, in exposing them as A front for British and U.\n\nS. Intelligence. And I was attacked in the New York review of books by journalist Janine DG Giovanni, who has very close ties to the U. S. State Department has gotten awards from the State Department, and she claimed that she You know, the, I think she claimed that the gray zone was launched by Russia, it was basically founded by the Russian government.\n\nThere's no evidence whatsoever. The New York review of books, by the way, is sponsored entirely, almost entirely by George Soros and his operation. And Soros had been identified as early as 1991 in the Washington post as an overt operator on behalf of us intelligence doing what the CIA used to do. in secret.\n\nHe was doing it openly and sponsoring regime change operations around the world to open up more post Soviet countries to his, business interests. And he had called for regime change in Syria and the pages of the New York review of books under his own name. So there was that attack. Then we started getting attacked by mainstream publications because at the gray zone, we were busting the Narrative that the Trump administration was putting out about a genocide of the Uyghur people in northwestern China.\n\nIn order to ramp up conflict with China, justify sanctions, and we clinically dismantled this narrative, which wasn't to say that Uyghur people haven't faced repression there. We can see what a facile narrative that was when the U. S. is denying that genocide is being committed in Gaza, when it's being live streamed right before our eyes and we're seeing 100 civilians, 200 civilians killed every day, along with mass displacement and famine.\n\nAttacks can have been continuous with October 7th, we've been attacked twice in major Washington Post features and the first one accused us of October 7th denialism and I think this is the key here to what's going on when you talk about American innocence. We're being accused of October 7th denialism.\n\nIt was a reporter named Liza Dvoskin. I clowned her by calling her live on a Grayzone livestream and demanding to know how she could accuse us of such a thing when we were publishing facts. And that didn't work out very well for her. But her main source on the article was It was another one of these censorship industrial complex outfits called the National Contagion Research Institute.\n\nAnd you take a look into what it is, it was founded by a former director of the Anti Defamation League. So it's the Israel lobby. It has tons of former DHS on its board. And it's been advised by a former Israeli intelligence officer, Seema Vakdan Gil, whose job was to defame and attack the Palestine Solidarity Movement.\n\ninside the United States to attack American citizens on behalf of Israel. That was the Washington Post source. But October 7th denialism, we were attacked again in the Washington Post with all of these spook sources for the same thing, for publishing quote unquote misinformation about October 7th. So what are we doing there that merits so many attacks in such a high profile publication?\n\nWe are preventing. Israel and the Biden administration and the, I guess the U. S. from consolidating this idea of the October 7th attack as a new Holocaust. That's what they are trying to do. They're already setting up de facto Holocaust museums, like a Nova Electronic Music Festival exhibit in New York City.\n\nWhich is like a clockwork orange style psychological attack on all visitors to make them hate Palestinians and Hamas to the point where they support what Israel's doing in Gaza That Israel's turning all the southern kibbutzim that were attacked into de facto Holocaust museums And if they can consolidate this narrative of October 7th, what they can do is then Prevent anyone from putting October 7th in historical or political context of an occupied people Breaking out of their prison and attacking their occupier, which isn't to say that atrocities didn't occur They can completely Delegitimize the Palestinian cause, but more than that, if they can turn October 7th into the new Holocaust, they can criminalize what they call October 7th denialism, because as we know, Holocaust denial has been criminalized in many countries in Western Europe.\n\nIn fact, the world's premier Holocaust revisionist, David Irving, spent time in prison in Austria The crime of denying the Holocaust and then it also classifies all of us who have tried to bust Israeli propaganda as David Irving as basically Nazis. And so I think that's our real crime here is we have prevented them from consolidating that, and therefore we have interrupted and undermined Israeli and American exceptionalism, I think, on a permanent basis.\n\nSo whatever happens to us, I'm really. I'm proud that we made that contribution because I believe in history. I believe in real politics, in context, and especially critical thinking.\n\nScheer: All right. I said, I'll let you go after 30 minutes, but this is 41. I want to for doing this and, yeah, it, I don't want to go into it, but people should read your book.\n\nWhat's the title again? I forgot on Israel. I found it. It's called Goliath. That's right, of course, Goliath. And what was so profound about that book, because I happened to be there at the Six Day War, at the end of the Six Day War, I was in Gaza, I was in the West Bank, and so forth, and, if you talk about fake history, my God, nobody ever mentions that there was no Palestinian Air Force, Navy, or Army, or anything that attacked Israel.\n\nIn fact, the Six Day War was a preemptive war, and that, that Israel had no trouble. The great Goliath then was supposed to be Egypt, which is really had a third world army and force. Israel had the U. S. behind it with great detail of accuracy in their intelligence gathering and weaponry and everything else.\n\nNonetheless, Israel made peace with Egypt, which had been, controlling Gaza. They made peace with Jordan, which had been controlling the West Bank. So the whole, I loved about your book is it's a denial of the David Goliath image. Israel was never David, the Palestinians, it's a joke to think of him as Goliath to this day.\n\nAnd so if you want to talk about fake history, that is a core right now. And as a matter of fact, if October 7th hadn't happened, Israel was in the process of embracing Saudi Arabia, which is the center of religious intolerance of this sort, and certainly not having any trouble with Egypt and so forth. So Goliath, very important book to demystify the whole subject.\n\nI want to thank you for doing this. I want to thank Christopher Ho and Laura Kondourajian at the NPR station KCRW in Santa Monica for hosting these shows. Joshua Scheer, our executive producer. Diego Ramos who writes the introduction and Max Jones who puts up the video and the JKW Foundation. I hope I'm not making life miserable for them, but in the memory of Jean Stein, I One of the rare American public intellectuals and writers who very early on, saw that, the Palestinians were hardly, the Goliath in this situation and, came to the support of Edward Said, one of our great scholars, asserting, this opposite view that the Palestinians are human beings like anyone else entitled to the same human rights as anyone else.\n\nSo on that note, see you next week with another edition. of sheer intelligence.\n\nfrom https://scheerpost.com/2024/06/14/max-blumenthal-the-washington-posts-attack-on-the-grayzone/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=max-blumenthal-the-washington-posts-attack-on-the-grayzone",

        "summary": "The Washington Post recently published and then retracted an article accusing The Grayzone, an independent media outlet, of receiving payments from Iranian media. Max Blumenthal, The Grayzone's editor-in-chief, discussed this incident with Robert Scheer on Scheer Intelligence, highlighting the broader implications for media integrity. Blumenthal criticized the Post for its baseless claims and suggested that such attacks are driven by those threatened by The Grayzone's factual reporting, particularly on sensitive topics like Israel and U.S. foreign policy. He argued that mainstream media, increasingly influenced by intelligence agencies, aims to discredit independent outlets to maintain control over public narratives. The controversy underscores the growing tension between legacy media and independent journalism, with significant implications for press freedom and public trust in media.",

        "title": "G7 leaders tackle migration, AI and economic security on final day of summit",
        "body": "The G7 leaders stressed their determination to meet global challenges \"at a crucial moment in history\".\n\nThe gathering in a luxury resort in Italy's southern Puglia region also discussed other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, the war in Gaza, climate change, Iran, the situation in the Red Sea, gender equality and China's industrial policy and economic security.\n\n\"We are working together and with others to address the pressing challenges of our time,\" the G7 leaders said in a final statement, noting their solidarity with Ukraine, support for a deal that would lead to an immediate ceasefire and release of hostages in Gaza, investment in sustainable infrastructure in Africa and commitments to address climate change and migration.\n\nDivisions did emerge during the summit, however, notably over the lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final declaration.\n\nAsked if the G7 gathering has lived up to expectations, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"The aim of the G7 is to create convergence and be able to remove misunderstandings. It's not a place where you decide emergency measures or regulate things.\" He added that there were \"true convergences on Ukraine and Mideast\".\n\n\"It was a useful G7, with useful results,\" Mr Macron said. \"The coming weeks will create the conditions for political opportunities in particular around the two conflicts.\"\n\nMigration was the first topic of discussions on Friday, with the leaders mulling ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.\n\nThe issue is of particular interest to summit host Italy, which lies on one of the major routes into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her hardline stance on migration, has been eager to increase investment and funding for African nations as a means of reducing migratory pressure on Europe.\n\nThe leaders \"launched the G7 Coalition to prevent and counter the smuggling of migrants\", the summit's final declaration said, noting the seven nations would \"focus on the root causes of irregular migration, efforts to enhance border management and curb transnational organised crime, and safe and regular pathways for migration\".\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he and Ms Meloni - whom he described as \"fantastic\" - saw \"eye to eye\" on migration.\n\n\"We can't have criminal gangs decide who comes to our countries,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\nMs Meloni has a controversial five-year deal with neighbouring Albania for the Balkan country to host thousands of asylum seekers while Italy processes their claims. She has also spearheaded the \"Mattei Plan\" for Africa, a continent-wide strategy to increase economic opportunities at home and so discourage migration.\n\nFor its part, Britain has a deal to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, although no flights have yet taken off. Human rights organisations have criticised the agreement as unethical and unworkable.\n\nThe United States has also been struggling with a growing number of migrants. President Joe Biden introduced new policies to curb migration after a Bill he tried to get through Congress failed to pass. However, the future of the new policies is unclear after immigrant rights advocates challenged them with lawsuits.\n\nApart from the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, the Italian hosts also invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Ms Meloni's migration and development initiatives.\n\nBut rights groups decried what they said was a lack of ambition in support for developing countries.\n\nThe ONE Campaign, which advocates for investment in Africa, said it had found the G7 and EU institutions' share of aid going to Africa was at its lowest point since 1973.\n\n\"Without any concrete action, the G7 in Italy amounts to no more than pointless platitudes,\" said David McNair, executive director at The ONE Campaign.\n\nAlthough the summit's final statement \"reflects promises of increased partnership between the G7 and Africa, there are very few specifics on what new financing, if any, will be available\".\n\nPope Francis also became the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, delivering a speech on artificial intelligence. Other invitees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe summit opened on Thursday with a strong show of support for Kyiv: an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion-dollar (£39.5 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denounced the freezing of Russian assets as \"theft\" and vowed it \"will not go unpunished\".\n\nMr Biden also signed a bilateral security agreement with Mr Zelensky, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv.\n\nBut some cracks appeared among the G7 leaders, notably Mr Macron deploring a lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final document.\n\nThe statement after last year's summit in Hiroshima, Japan, expressed a commitment to provide access to safe and legal abortion to women and girls, and pledged to defend gender equality and the rights of members of the LGBT+ community.\n\nThe word \"abortion\" was absent from this year's final communique, although it included a reference to promoting sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\n\"It was not possible to reach agreement on these things in the room,\" a senior EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the private discussions.\n\nAsked on Thursday about reports that abortion would not be included in the final text, Mr Macron said it was something he regretted.\n\nFrance \"has included women's right to abortion, the freedom of decision on one's own body, into its constitution\", he said, adding that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men\".\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" Mr Macron said.\n\nMs Meloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has denied she is rolling back rights to abortions, which have been legal in Italy since 1978. But the centre-left opposition has warned that her initiatives are chipping away at those rights, including by giving pro-life groups access to women considering abortions.",

The ship is now drifting in the Red Sea. The attack is part of a series of Huthi assaults on maritime traffic since the Israel-Hamas war began, forcing detours for many vessels. The UK Maritime Trade Operations, run by the British navy, confirmed the crew's evacuation. Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos pledged to assist the Filipino crew members. This incident marks the first use of remote-controlled, water-borne explosives by the Huthis. The UN and US have expressed concerns over escalating hostilities, with recent Huthi actions including the arrest of aid workers and attacks on other ships. The conflict in Yemen, ongoing since 2014, has resulted in significant casualties and a humanitarian crisis.",

        "title": "G7 leaders tackle migration, AI and economic security on final day of summit",
        "body": "The G7 leaders stressed their determination to meet global challenges \"at a crucial moment in history\".\n\nThe gathering in a luxury resort in Italy's southern Puglia region also discussed other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, the war in Gaza, climate change, Iran, the situation in the Red Sea, gender equality and China's industrial policy and economic security.\n\n\"We are working together and with others to address the pressing challenges of our time,\" the G7 leaders said in a final statement, noting their solidarity with Ukraine, support for a deal that would lead to an immediate ceasefire and release of hostages in Gaza, investment in sustainable infrastructure in Africa and commitments to address climate change and migration.\n\nDivisions did emerge during the summit, however, notably over the lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final declaration.\n\nAsked if the G7 gathering has lived up to expectations, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"The aim of the G7 is to create convergence and be able to remove misunderstandings. It's not a place where you decide emergency measures or regulate things.\" He added that there were \"true convergences on Ukraine and Mideast\".\n\n\"It was a useful G7, with useful results,\" Mr Macron said. \"The coming weeks will create the conditions for political opportunities in particular around the two conflicts.\"\n\nMigration was the first topic of discussions on Friday, with the leaders mulling ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.\n\nThe issue is of particular interest to summit host Italy, which lies on one of the major routes into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her hardline stance on migration, has been eager to increase investment and funding for African nations as a means of reducing migratory pressure on Europe.\n\nThe leaders \"launched the G7 Coalition to prevent and counter the smuggling of migrants\", the summit's final declaration said, noting the seven nations would \"focus on the root causes of irregular migration, efforts to enhance border management and curb transnational organised crime, and safe and regular pathways for migration\".\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he and Ms Meloni - whom he described as \"fantastic\" - saw \"eye to eye\" on migration.\n\n\"We can't have criminal gangs decide who comes to our countries,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\nMs Meloni has a controversial five-year deal with neighbouring Albania for the Balkan country to host thousands of asylum seekers while Italy processes their claims. She has also spearheaded the \"Mattei Plan\" for Africa, a continent-wide strategy to increase economic opportunities at home and so discourage migration.\n\nFor its part, Britain has a deal to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, although no flights have yet taken off. Human rights organisations have criticised the agreement as unethical and unworkable.\n\nThe United States has also been struggling with a growing number of migrants. President Joe Biden introduced new policies to curb migration after a Bill he tried to get through Congress failed to pass. However, the future of the new policies is unclear after immigrant rights advocates challenged them with lawsuits.\n\nApart from the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, the Italian hosts also invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Ms Meloni's migration and development initiatives.\n\nBut rights groups decried what they said was a lack of ambition in support for developing countries.\n\nThe ONE Campaign, which advocates for investment in Africa, said it had found the G7 and EU institutions' share of aid going to Africa was at its lowest point since 1973.\n\n\"Without any concrete action, the G7 in Italy amounts to no more than pointless platitudes,\" said David McNair, executive director at The ONE Campaign.\n\nAlthough the summit's final statement \"reflects promises of increased partnership between the G7 and Africa, there are very few specifics on what new financing, if any, will be available\".\n\nPope Francis also became the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, delivering a speech on artificial intelligence. Other invitees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe summit opened on Thursday with a strong show of support for Kyiv: an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion-dollar (£39.5 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denounced the freezing of Russian assets as \"theft\" and vowed it \"will not go unpunished\".\n\nMr Biden also signed a bilateral security agreement with Mr Zelensky, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv.\n\nBut some cracks appeared among the G7 leaders, notably Mr Macron deploring a lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final document.\n\nThe statement after last year's summit in Hiroshima, Japan, expressed a commitment to provide access to safe and legal abortion to women and girls, and pledged to defend gender equality and the rights of members of the LGBT+ community.\n\nThe word \"abortion\" was absent from this year's final communique, although it included a reference to promoting sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\n\"It was not possible to reach agreement on these things in the room,\" a senior EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the private discussions.\n\nAsked on Thursday about reports that abortion would not be included in the final text, Mr Macron said it was something he regretted.\n\nFrance \"has included women's right to abortion, the freedom of decision on one's own body, into its constitution\", he said, adding that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men\".\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" Mr Macron said.\n\nMs Meloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has denied she is rolling back rights to abortions, which have been legal in Italy since 1978. But the centre-left opposition has warned that her initiatives are chipping away at those rights, including by giving pro-life groups access to women considering abortions.",

The leaders emphasized their commitment to tackling these challenges collectively, highlighting solidarity with Ukraine, a ceasefire in Gaza, sustainable infrastructure in Africa, and climate change. However, divisions emerged, particularly over the omission of abortion in the final declaration.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her strict migration policies, pushed for increased investment in African nations to reduce migratory pressures. The G7 launched a coalition to combat migrant smuggling and address the root causes of irregular migration. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak supported Meloni's stance, emphasizing the need to prevent criminal gangs from controlling migration.\n\nThe summit also saw participation from African leaders and other global figures, including Pope Francis, who spoke on artificial intelligence. The G7 agreed on a $50 billion loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets, a move criticized by Russian President Vladimir Putin. U.S. President Joe Biden signed a security agreement with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nDespite the summit's achievements, some criticized the lack of concrete support for developing countries and the absence of specific financial commitments. French President Emmanuel Macron expressed regret over the exclusion of abortion from the final document, a point of contention among the leaders.",

        "body": "The United States on Friday announced another $315 million for hungry Sudanese as it pressed the warring sides to end obstruction of aid, warning that a famine of historic proportions could unfold without urgent action.\n\nThe assistance will include food and drinking water, as well as malnutrition emergency screening and treatment for children.\n\nIt comes as estimates say that five million people inside Sudan suffer extreme hunger, with food lacking also in neighboring countries where two million Sudanese have fled.\n\n\"We need the world to wake up to the catastrophe happening before our very eyes,\" Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters.\n\n\"We've seen mortality projections estimating that in excess of 2.5 million people -- about 15 percent of the population -- in Darfur and Kordofan, the hardest-hit regions, could die by the end of September,\" she said.\n\n\"This is the largest humanitarian crisis on the face of the planet, and yet somehow it threatens to get worse,\" she said, pointing to expectations that the key border crossing will become unpassable with the rainy season.\n\nA UN humanitarian appeal for Sudan has received only 16 percent of its target, with much global attention focused instead on Gaza, where aid workers have also warned of famine risks.\n\nSamantha Power, the administrator of the US Agency for International Development (USAID), said Sudan could be in worse shape than Somalia in 2011 when some 250,000 people died after three consecutive seasons without enough rain in a country grappling with near anarchy.\n\n\"The most worrying scenario would be that Sudan would become the deadliest famine since Ethiopia in the early 1980s,\" when as many as 1.2 million people died, she said.\n\nSudan descended into war in April 2023 when the generals in charge of the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) took up arms to seize control, rejecting a plan to integrate.\n\nWith the two sides battling for power across the country, Power said that deliveries of aid across the rival sides' lines of control was \"virtually non-existent.\"\n\nPower strongly criticized both sides. The RSF, she said, has been \"systematically looting humanitarian warehouses, stealing food and livestock, destroying grain storage facilities and wells in the most vulnerable Sudanese communities.\"\n\nThe army, in turn \"completely contradicts its commitments and its responsibility\" to the Sudanese people by blocking aid from crossing the border with Chad into Darfur, she said.\n\n\"The really clear message here is that it is obstruction, not insufficient stocks of food, that is the driving force behind the historic and deadly levels of starvation in Sudan,\" she said.\n\n\"That has to change immediately.\"\n\n- Diplomacy struggles -\n\nRepeated US-led efforts to end the conflict have failed, with many observers concluding that the warring generals each think they can win on the ground.\n\nA number of foreign powers have supported rival forces. Sudan expelled diplomats from the United Arab Emirates on allegations of fueling the RSF, while Egypt, Turkey and Iran have backed the army.\n\nRecent fighting in El-Fasher, the last city in Darfur outside RSF control, has killed more than 220 people, according to charity Doctors Without Borders.\n\nThe UN Security Council on Thursday demanded that the RSF halt the siege, with all countries voting in favor except Russia, which abstained.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken late last month called Sudan's army chief, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and pressed both for humanitarian access and a resumption of diplomacy between the two sides.\n\nTalks last year in the Saudi port city of Jeddah, brokered by the United States and Saudi Arabia, only briefly paused fighting, and a US push to restart the process has been unsuccessful.\n\n\"We know that there is no acceptable military solution to this conflict,\" Thomas-Greenfield said.\n\n\"We have been disappointed with the delays.\"\n\nsct/st\n\nFOX28 Spokane©",

The conflict in Sudan, which began in April 2023 between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), has severely obstructed aid delivery. The RSF has been accused of looting humanitarian supplies, while the army has blocked aid from entering Darfur. Diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict have so far failed, with foreign powers backing different sides.

The RSF, she said, has been \"systematically looting humanitarian warehouses, stealing food and livestock, destroying grain storage facilities and wells in the most vulnerable Sudanese communities.\"\n\nThe army, in turn \"completely contradicts its commitments and its responsibility\" to the Sudanese people by blocking aid from crossing the border with Chad into Darfur, she said.\n\n\"The really clear message here is that it is obstruction, not insufficient stocks of food, that is the driving force behind the historic and deadly levels of starvation in Sudan,\" she said.\n\n\"That has to change immediately.\"\n\n- Diplomacy struggles -\n\nRepeated US-led efforts to end the conflict have failed, with many observers concluding that the warring generals each think they can win on the ground.\n\nA number of foreign powers have supported rival forces. Sudan expelled diplomats from the United Arab Emirates on allegations of fueling the RSF, while Egypt, Turkey and Iran have backed the army.\n\nRecent fighting in El-Fasher, the last city in Darfur outside RSF control, has killed more than 220 people, according to charity Doctors Without Borders.\n\nThe UN Security Council on Thursday demanded that the RSF halt the siege, with all countries voting in favor except Russia, which abstained.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken late last month called Sudan's army chief, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and pressed both for humanitarian access and a resumption of diplomacy between the two sides.\n\nTalks last year in the Saudi port city of Jeddah, brokered by the United States and Saudi Arabia, only briefly paused fighting, and a US push to restart the process has been unsuccessful.\n\n\"We know that there is no acceptable military solution to this conflict,\" Thomas-Greenfield said.\n\n\"We have been disappointed with the delays.\"\n\nsct/st",

        "summary": "The United States has announced an additional $315 million in aid for Sudan, aimed at addressing severe hunger and providing food, drinking water, and emergency malnutrition treatment for children. This comes amid warnings of a potential historic famine, with estimates suggesting that 2.5 million people in Darfur and Kordofan could die by the end of September. The conflict in Sudan, which began in April 2023 between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), has severely obstructed aid delivery. The RSF has been accused of looting humanitarian supplies, while the army has blocked aid from entering Darfur. Diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict have failed, with foreign powers backing different sides. The UN Security Council has called for an end to the RSF siege in El-Fasher, where recent fighting has killed over 220 people. US officials emphasize that obstruction, not food shortages, is driving the crisis and call for immediate changes to allow aid to reach those in need.",

        "body": "The crew of a ship that was holed in an attack by Yemen's Huthi rebels has been evacuated and the vessel is drifting in the Red Sea, a security agency said on Friday.\n\nThe MV Tutor was abandoned after it was struck by a sea drone off rebel-held Hodeida on Wednesday, causing serious flooding, in the latest in a series of Huthi attacks.\n\nThe Iran-backed rebels have been harassing the vital sealane since shortly after the start of the Israel-Hamas war, forcing much marine traffic into lengthy detours.\n\n\"The crew of the vessel has been evacuated by military authorities,\" said the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, which is run by the British navy.\n\n\"The vessel has been abandoned and is drifting.\"\n\nPhilippines President Ferdinand Marcos had earlier pledged to help the Filipino seamen on board and transfer them to Djibouti, across the Red Sea from Yemen, with the UKMTO's help.\n\n\"We are doing everything that we can do,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe Liberian-flagged, Greek-owned and operated merchant ship was hit by a sea drone and an \"unknown aerial projectile\", the US military's Central Command said on Wednesday.\n\nSecurity firm Ambrey said it was the first time the Huthis had hit a ship using remote-controlled, water-borne explosives.\n\nIt was one of a surge of attacks this week, one of which badly injured a sailor who was evacuated by US forces from the MV Verbena in the Gulf of Aden on Thursday.\n\nThey follow the latest retaliatory strikes by US and British forces last month which killed 16 people, according to the Huthis, who threatened to escalate their activities.\n\n- 'Spy network' -\n\nOn Thursday, the United Nations special envoy Hans Grundberg warned of a slide back towards full-blown hostilities after a lull in Yemen's civil war.\n\n\"If the parties continue the current escalatory trajectory, the question is not if but when the parties revert to escalation on the battlefield,\" he told the UN Security Council in a briefing.\n\nApart from the Red Sea attacks, the Huthis this week arrested more than a dozen aid workers, including UN staff, accusing them of being part of a \"US-Israeli spy network\".\n\nUN human rights chief Volker Turk dismissed the \"outrageous allegations\" and demanded their immediate release.\n\nLast week, at least 18 combatants were killed in battles between the Huthis and Yemeni government forces in the country's southwest, two military officials told AFP.\n\nMeanwhile, a dispute between rival monetary authorities in rebel and government-controlled areas threatens to cut off banks in Sanaa from international transactions, further roiling Yemen's stricken economy.\n\nThe Huthis, who control much of Yemen, seized the capital Sanaa in 2014, prompting a Saudi-led military intervention in support of the government the following year.\n\nThey say their scores of Red Sea attacks since November are in support of Palestinians in Gaza as part of Iran's \"axis of resistance\" to the US and Israel.\n\nAmong the most notable attacks, the Huthis stormed and hijacked a vehicle-carrier, the Galaxy Leader, in November, later opening it as a tourist attraction for propaganda purposes.\n\nIn March, the Rubymar bulk carrier, carrying thousands of tonnes of fertiliser, sank in the Red Sea after its hull was damaged in a Huthi missile strike.\n\nYemen's war has left hundreds of thousands of people dead, through fighting or indirect causes such as disease or lack of food, with most of the population dependent on aid.\n\nth/kir",

        "title": "Ramaphosa set for re-election in South Africa after coalition agreement",
        "body": "The deal, which parties referred to as a government of national unity, will bring the ANC together in government with the Democratic Alliance (DA), a white-led party that had for years been the main opposition and a fierce foe for the ANC.\n\nAt least two other smaller parties will also be part of the agreement that put South Africa into uncharted waters with the first national coalition government in its democratic history.\n\n\"The government of national unity is on track,\" ANC secretary-general Fikile Mbalula said. \"For the interest of the country, we said let's work together. We have no fear of that.\"\n\nThe agreement was necessary after the ANC lost its 30-year majority in a humbling national election for it last month. It was a turning point for Africa's most industrialised economy. The ANC is the party of Nelson Mandela and had governed with a comfortable majority ever since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994.\n\nThat three-decade dominance ended in the May 29 election, when the ANC's share of the vote dropped to 40% amid discontent from South Africans over high levels of poverty, inequality and unemployment.\n\nAll the parties have said they would put their differences aside to work in the best interests of the country.\n\nHowever, analysts warned there might be complications ahead given the starkly different ideologies of the ANC, a former liberation movement, and the centrist, business-friendly DA -- the two biggest parties and the key players. The DA won 21% of the vote in the national election, the second largest share.\n\nFor one, the DA disagreed with the ANC government's move to accuse Israel of genocide in Gaza in a highly sensitive case at the United Nations' top court.\n\nDA leader John Steenhuisen was the first to confirm that an agreement was dramatically signed on Friday when Parliament was in a break.\n\n\"From today, the DA will co-govern the Republic of South Africa in a spirit of unity and collaboration,\" Mr Steenhuisen said as he broke away from the proceedings to make a speech that was carried live on television. He called it an \"historic step forward.\"\n\nMr Steenhuisen said the DA would back the 71-year-old Mr Ramaphosa for president and because the two parties have a clear joint majority of seats in Parliament, Mr Ramaphosa's re-election now appeared to be assured.\n\nThe Parliament session first went through the hours-long swearing-in of hundreds of new MPs and electing a speaker and a deputy speaker, before the house set to vote on the president, well into the night. Two candidates were nominated -- Mr Ramaphosa and Julius Malema, the leader of the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters party which had refused to join the unity government.\n\nA majority of the votes cast in a secret ballot in the 400-member lower house of Parliament, called the National Assembly, was required to elect a president.\n\nFormer President Jacob Zuma's MK Party was boycotting the session, which did not after the voting as only a third of the house is needed for a quorum.\n\nParliament convened in an unusual setting after a fire in 2022 gutted the National Assembly building in Cape Town and lawmakers came together at a conference centre near the city's waterfront.\n\nTwo other smaller parties said they would be part of the coalition agreement and Mr Mbalula said the ANC was open to talking with anyone else who wanted to join the unity government.\n\nThere are 18 political parties represented in Parliament and Mr Mbalula said the multi-party agreement would \"prioritise the country across the political and ideological divide\". Some parties refused to join.\n\nThe other two parties to join were the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Patriotic Alliance, which has drawn attention because of its strong anti-immigration stance and because its leader, Gayton McKenzie, served a prison sentence for bank robbery.\n\n\"The deal is we are putting South Africa first,\" Mr McKenzie said in an interview on state broadcaster SABC. \"We are going to work together. We have decided we are not going to let South Africa die in our hands, on our watch.\"\n\nThe ANC had faced a deadline to get a coalition agreement given parliament had to sit for the first time and vote for the president within 14 days of the election results being declared on June 2.\n\nThe ANC had been trying to strike a coalition agreement for two weeks and the final negotiations went through the night Thursday and into Friday, party officials said.\n\nSouth Africa had not faced this level of political uncertainty since the ANC swept to power in the first all-race election in 1994 that ended nearly a half-century of racial segregation.\n\nThe party had held a clear majority in parliament since then, meaning parliamentary votes for the president were formalities and every South African leader since had been from the ANC, starting with Mr Mandela.\n\nThis unity government also harked back to the way Mr Mandela, South Africa's first black president, invited political opponents to be part of a new unity government in 1994 in an act of reconciliation. The ANC's hand was forced this time.\n\n\"The ANC has been very magnanimous in that they have accepted defeat and have said, 'let's talk',\" PA leader Mr McKenzie said.",

        "summary": "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is set for re-election following a historic coalition agreement between the African National Congress (ANC) and the Democratic Alliance (DA), along with two smaller parties, the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Patriotic Alliance. This coalition, termed a government of national unity, was necessitated after the ANC lost its 30-year majority in the recent national election, securing only 40% of the vote. The DA, which won 21%, will now co-govern with the ANC, marking the first national coalition government in South Africa's democratic history.\n\nThe agreement aims to address national issues such as poverty, inequality, and unemployment, despite the differing ideologies of the ANC and DA. DA leader John Steenhuisen confirmed the coalition and expressed support for Ramaphosa's presidency. The coalition agreement was finalized just before the parliamentary session, which included the swearing-in of new MPs and the election of a speaker and deputy speaker.\n\nThe session took place in a conference center due to a fire that damaged the National Assembly building in 2022. Former President Jacob Zuma's MK Party boycotted the session. The coalition agreement is seen as a significant step towards political stability and cooperation in South Africa, reminiscent of Nelson Mandela's inclusive government in 1994.",

        "body": "The leaders stressed their determination to meet global challenges 'at a crucial moment in history'.\n\nThe Group of Seven leading industrialised nations turned their attention to migration, artificial intelligence, economic security and the Indo-Pacific region on Friday, the second and final day of their summit in Italy.\n\nThe G7 leaders stressed their determination to meet global challenges \"at a crucial moment in history\".\n\nThe gathering in a luxury resort in Italy's southern Puglia region also discussed other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, the war in Gaza, climate change, Iran, the situation in the Red Sea, gender equality and China's industrial policy and economic security.\n\n\"We are working together and with others to address the pressing challenges of our time,\" the G7 leaders said in a final statement, noting their solidarity with Ukraine, support for a deal that would lead to an immediate ceasefire and release of hostages in Gaza, investment in sustainable infrastructure in Africa and commitments to address climate change and migration.\n\nDivisions did emerge during the summit, however, notably over the lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final declaration.\n\nAsked if the G7 gathering has lived up to expectations, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"The aim of the G7 is to create convergence and be able to remove misunderstandings. It's not a place where you decide emergency measures or regulate things.\" He added that there were \"true convergences on Ukraine and Mideast\".\n\n\"It was a useful G7, with useful results,\" Mr Macron said. \"The coming weeks will create the conditions for political opportunities in particular around the two conflicts.\"\n\nMigration was the first topic of discussions on Friday, with the leaders mulling ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.\n\nThe issue is of particular interest to summit host Italy, which lies on one of the major routes into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her hardline stance on migration, has been eager to increase investment and funding for African nations as a means of reducing migratory pressure on Europe.\n\nThe leaders \"launched the G7 Coalition to prevent and counter the smuggling of migrants\", the summit's final declaration said, noting the seven nations would \"focus on the root causes of irregular migration, efforts to enhance border management and curb transnational organised crime, and safe and regular pathways for migration\".\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he and Ms Meloni - whom he described as \"fantastic\" - saw \"eye to eye\" on migration.\n\n\"We can't have criminal gangs decide who comes to our countries,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\nMs Meloni has a controversial five-year deal with neighbouring Albania for the Balkan country to host thousands of asylum seekers while Italy processes their claims. She has also spearheaded the \"Mattei Plan\" for Africa, a continent-wide strategy to increase economic opportunities at home and so discourage migration.\n\nFor its part, Britain has a deal to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, although no flights have yet taken off. Human rights organisations have criticised the agreement as unethical and unworkable.\n\nThe United States has also been struggling with a growing number of migrants. President Joe Biden introduced new policies to curb migration after a Bill he tried to get through Congress failed to pass. However, the future of the new policies is unclear after immigrant rights advocates challenged them with lawsuits.\n\nApart from the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, the Italian hosts also invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Ms Meloni's migration and development initiatives.\n\nBut rights groups decried what they said was a lack of ambition in support for developing countries.\n\nThe ONE Campaign, which advocates for investment in Africa, said it had found the G7 and EU institutions' share of aid going to Africa was at its lowest point since 1973.\n\n\"Without any concrete action, the G7 in Italy amounts to no more than pointless platitudes,\" said David McNair, executive director at The ONE Campaign.\n\nAlthough the summit's final statement \"reflects promises of increased partnership between the G7 and Africa, there are very few specifics on what new financing, if any, will be available\".\n\nPope Francis also became the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, delivering a speech on artificial intelligence. Other invitees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe summit opened on Thursday with a strong show of support for Kyiv: an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion-dollar (£39.5 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denounced the freezing of Russian assets as \"theft\" and vowed it \"will not go unpunished\".\n\nMr Biden also signed a bilateral security agreement with Mr Zelensky, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv.\n\nBut some cracks appeared among the G7 leaders, notably Mr Macron deploring a lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final document.\n\nThe statement after last year's summit in Hiroshima, Japan, expressed a commitment to provide access to safe and legal abortion to women and girls, and pledged to defend gender equality and the rights of members of the LGBT+ community.\n\nThe word \"abortion\" was absent from this year's final communique, although it included a reference to promoting sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\n\"It was not possible to reach agreement on these things in the room,\" a senior EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the private discussions.\n\nAsked on Thursday about reports that abortion would not be included in the final text, Mr Macron said it was something he regretted.\n\nFrance \"has included women's right to abortion, the freedom of decision on one's own body, into its constitution\", he said, adding that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men\".\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" Mr Macron said.\n\nMs Meloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has denied she is rolling back rights to abortions, which have been legal in Italy since 1978. But the centre-left opposition has warned that her initiatives are chipping away at those rights, including by giving pro-life groups access to women considering abortions.",

        "title": "G7 leaders tackle migration, AI and economic security on final day of summit",
        "body": "The G7 leaders stressed their determination to meet global challenges \"at a crucial moment in history\".\n\nThe gathering in a luxury resort in Italy's southern Puglia region also discussed other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, the war in Gaza, climate change, Iran, the situation in the Red Sea, gender equality and China's industrial policy and economic security.\n\n\"We are working together and with others to address the pressing challenges of our time,\" the G7 leaders said in a final statement, noting their solidarity with Ukraine, support for a deal that would lead to an immediate ceasefire and release of hostages in Gaza, investment in sustainable infrastructure in Africa and commitments to address climate change and migration.\n\nDivisions did emerge during the summit, however, notably over the lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final declaration.\n\nAsked if the G7 gathering has lived up to expectations, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"The aim of the G7 is to create convergence and be able to remove misunderstandings. It's not a place where you decide emergency measures or regulate things.\" He added that there were \"true convergences on Ukraine and Mideast\".\n\n\"It was a useful G7, with useful results,\" Mr Macron said. \"The coming weeks will create the conditions for political opportunities in particular around the two conflicts.\"\n\nMigration was the first topic of discussions on Friday, with the leaders mulling ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.\n\nThe issue is of particular interest to summit host Italy, which lies on one of the major routes into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her hardline stance on migration, has been eager to increase investment and funding for African nations as a means of reducing migratory pressure on Europe.\n\nThe leaders \"launched the G7 Coalition to prevent and counter the smuggling of migrants\", the summit's final declaration said, noting the seven nations would \"focus on the root causes of irregular migration, efforts to enhance border management and curb transnational organised crime, and safe and regular pathways for migration\".\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he and Ms Meloni - whom he described as \"fantastic\" - saw \"eye to eye\" on migration.\n\n\"We can't have criminal gangs decide who comes to our countries,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\nMs Meloni has a controversial five-year deal with neighbouring Albania for the Balkan country to host thousands of asylum seekers while Italy processes their claims. She has also spearheaded the \"Mattei Plan\" for Africa, a continent-wide strategy to increase economic opportunities at home and so discourage migration.\n\nFor its part, Britain has a deal to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, although no flights have yet taken off. Human rights organisations have criticised the agreement as unethical and unworkable.\n\nThe United States has also been struggling with a growing number of migrants. President Joe Biden introduced new policies to curb migration after a Bill he tried to get through Congress failed to pass. However, the future of the new policies is unclear after immigrant rights advocates challenged them with lawsuits.\n\nApart from the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, the Italian hosts also invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Ms Meloni's migration and development initiatives.\n\nBut rights groups decried what they said was a lack of ambition in support for developing countries.\n\nThe ONE Campaign, which advocates for investment in Africa, said it had found the G7 and EU institutions' share of aid going to Africa was at its lowest point since 1973.\n\n\"Without any concrete action, the G7 in Italy amounts to no more than pointless platitudes,\" said David McNair, executive director at The ONE Campaign.\n\nAlthough the summit's final statement \"reflects promises of increased partnership between the G7 and Africa, there are very few specifics on what new financing, if any, will be available\".\n\nPope Francis also became the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, delivering a speech on artificial intelligence. Other invitees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe summit opened on Thursday with a strong show of support for Kyiv: an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion-dollar (£39.5 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denounced the freezing of Russian assets as \"theft\" and vowed it \"will not go unpunished\".\n\nMr Biden also signed a bilateral security agreement with Mr Zelensky, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv.\n\nBut some cracks appeared among the G7 leaders, notably Mr Macron deploring a lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final document.\n\nThe statement after last year's summit in Hiroshima, Japan, expressed a commitment to provide access to safe and legal abortion to women and girls, and pledged to defend gender equality and the rights of members of the LGBT+ community.\n\nThe word \"abortion\" was absent from this year's final communique, although it included a reference to promoting sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\n\"It was not possible to reach agreement on these things in the room,\" a senior EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the private discussions.\n\nAsked on Thursday about reports that abortion would not be included in the final text, Mr Macron said it was something he regretted.\n\nFrance \"has included women's right to abortion, the freedom of decision on one's own body, into its constitution\", he said, adding that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men\".\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" Mr Macron said.\n\nMs Meloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has denied she is rolling back rights to abortions, which have been legal in Italy since 1978. But the centre-left opposition has warned that her initiatives are chipping away at those rights, including by giving pro-life groups access to women considering abortions.",

The leaders emphasized their commitment to tackling these challenges collectively, expressing solidarity with Ukraine and advocating for a ceasefire in Gaza. They also launched a coalition to combat migrant smuggling and discussed investment in sustainable infrastructure in Africa.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her strict migration policies, pushed for increased investment in African nations to reduce migratory pressures. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak supported her stance, while the U.S. and other G7 nations also grappled with migration issues.\n\nThe summit saw some disagreements, particularly over the omission of abortion from the final declaration, a point lamented by French President Emmanuel Macron. Despite this, Macron described the summit as productive, especially regarding Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\nPope Francis addressed the summit on artificial intelligence, and other notable attendees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and leaders from Brazil, India, and Turkey. The summit began with a strong show of support for Ukraine, including a $50 billion loan backed by frozen Russian assets, which Russian President Vladimir Putin condemned.\n\nRights groups criticized the G7 for insufficient support for developing countries, with the ONE Campaign highlighting a decline in aid to Africa. The final statement promised increased partnership with Africa but lacked specific financial commitments.",

        "title": "Democrats Throwing a Tantrum Over Netanyahu's Speech to Congress",
        "body": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to Washington on July 24 and speak to a joint session of Congress.\n\nLikely, no more than a handful of Democrats will hear the speech. They're in trouble with their Muslim and youth constituencies because of their support of Israel in their existential war of survival.\n\nEven now as they back off that support, the damage to the Democratic coalition may end up handing Republicans a devastating victory in November.\n\nAbout all the Democrats can do is boycott the speech. That is unless they want to act like college kids and find a way to disrupt the speech.\n\nAs it stands now, Democrats are looking to develop \"counterprogramming\" to Netanyuahu's speech. It may take the form of a vigil of some kind or perhaps an event with families of American hostages whom Hamas is still holding. The Democrats are looking for some way to embarrass Netanyahu while he's on American soil.\n\n\"These conversations are happening. And it's not just progressives,\" one House Democrat involved in the discussions told Axios.\n\n\"We are hearing from others in the caucus that they would like to be part of counter-programming that is focused on peace, bringing the hostages home, and ending this horrible conflict,\" the lawmaker said.\n\nThe Hill:\n\nThe bad blood between Netanyahu and liberals on Capitol Hill is hardly new. Progressive Democrats have long denounced Netanyahu's conservative policies, including his sharp criticisms of the Iran nuclear deal under former President Obama, which led to a boycott of the prime minister's last speech to Congress almost a decade ago. Those old hostilities are still lingering, even as Democrats have found new reason to revile Netanyahu over his military campaign in Gaza.\n\n\"He imported a little bit of controversy the last time he was here,\" Rep. Stephen F. Lynch (D-Mass.) said. \"I thought it was disrespectful to the president, so I'm inclined not to attend.\"\n\n\"More moderate Dems are extremely frustrated that this Netanyahu visit undermines the work of the Biden administration and is disrespectful to Israelis who want Netanyahu out,\" the unnamed lawmaker told Axios.\n\nCriticizing Netanyahu for disrespecting people who want to throw him out of office might be one of the dumbest things a Democrat has ever said.\n\nThere are going to be a few Democrats there.\n\n\"They're our strongest ally in the Middle East. He's obviously the leader that they've chosen. And I respect the country very much, and I will be there,\" Rep. Juan Vargas (D-Calif.) said.\n\nFor his part, Netanyahu's office says he will emphasize the \"just war\" that Israel has been engaged in.\n\n\"I am very moved to have the privilege of representing Israel before both Houses of Congress and to present the truth about our just war against those who seek to destroy us to the representatives of the American people and the entire world,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nRepublican leaders Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell issued a joint statement saying the speech \"symbolizes\" the \"enduring relationship between the two countries.\n\n\"The bipartisan, bicameral meeting symbolizes the US and Israel's enduring relationship and will offer Prime Minister Netanyahu the opportunity to share the Israeli government's vision for defending their democracy, combatting terror, and establishing just and lasting peace in the region,\" the statement said.\n\nNetanyahu really gave it to the Democrats during his last joint address in 2015. That was in the midst of the debate over the Iran nuclear deal, and Democrats thought that Netanyahu was undermining Barack Obama at the time. They were right. Netanyahu was trying desperately to torpedo that deal before Congress could approve it. He failed and the results of that failure with Iran now attacking Israel are self-evident.",

        "summary": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scheduled to address a joint session of the U.S. Congress on July 24. However, many Democrats are expected to boycott the speech due to internal pressures from their Muslim and youth constituencies, and longstanding grievances with Netanyahu's policies, including his stance on the Iran nuclear deal and his military actions in Gaza. Some Democrats are planning \"counterprogramming\" events, such as vigils or meetings with families of American hostages held by Hamas, to protest Netanyahu's visit. Despite the boycott, a few Democrats, like Rep. Juan Vargas, plan to attend, citing Israel as a key ally. Netanyahu aims to highlight Israel's \"just war\" against its adversaries, while Republican leaders emphasize the enduring U.S.-Israel relationship. The visit recalls Netanyahu's controversial 2015 address, which was seen as an attempt to undermine then-President Obama's Iran deal.",

        "body": "The crew of a ship that was holed in an attack by Yemen's Huthi rebels has been evacuated and the vessel is drifting in the Red Sea, a security agency said on Friday.\n\nThe MV Tutor was abandoned after it was struck by a sea drone off rebel-held Hodeida on Wednesday, causing serious flooding, in the latest in a series of Huthi attacks.\n\nThe Iran-backed rebels have been harassing the vital sealane since shortly after the start of the Israel-Hamas war, forcing much marine traffic into lengthy detours.\n\n\"The crew of the vessel has been evacuated by military authorities,\" said the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, which is run by the British navy.\n\n\"The vessel has been abandoned and is drifting.\"\n\nPhilippines President Ferdinand Marcos had earlier pledged to help the Filipino seamen on board and transfer them to Djibouti, across the Red Sea from Yemen, with the UKMTO's help.\n\n\"We are doing everything that we can do,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe Liberian-flagged, Greek-owned and operated merchant ship was hit by a sea drone and an \"unknown aerial projectile\", the US military's Central Command said on Wednesday.\n\nSecurity firm Ambrey said it was the first time the Huthis had hit a ship using remote-controlled, water-borne explosives.\n\nIt was one of a surge of attacks this week, one of which badly injured a sailor who was evacuated by US forces from the MV Verbena in the Gulf of Aden on Thursday.\n\nThey follow the latest retaliatory strikes by US and British forces last month which killed 16 people, according to the Huthis, who threatened to escalate their activities.\n\n- 'Spy network' - More from this section How Apple's AI Strategy Deviates from Microsoft and Google and What It Means for Users Christopher Hope defends GB News after backlash from Gina Miller: 'People who attack this channel just don't watch it!' S&P 500, Nasdaq at records despite Fed seeing fewer rate cuts in 2024\n\nOn Thursday, the United Nations special envoy Hans Grundberg warned of a slide back towards full-blown hostilities after a lull in Yemen's civil war.\n\n\"If the parties continue the current escalatory trajectory, the question is not if but when the parties revert to escalation on the battlefield,\" he told the UN Security Council in a briefing.\n\nApart from the Red Sea attacks, the Huthis this week arrested more than a dozen aid workers, including UN staff, accusing them of being part of a \"US-Israeli spy network\".\n\nUN human rights chief Volker Turk dismissed the \"outrageous allegations\" and demanded their immediate release.\n\nLast week, at least 18 combatants were killed in battles between the Huthis and Yemeni government forces in the country's southwest, two military officials told AFP.\n\nMeanwhile, a dispute between rival monetary authorities in rebel and government-controlled areas threatens to cut off banks in Sanaa from international transactions, further roiling Yemen's stricken economy.\n\nThe Huthis, who control much of Yemen, seized the capital Sanaa in 2014, prompting a Saudi-led military intervention in support of the government the following year.\n\nThey say their scores of Red Sea attacks since November are in support of Palestinians in Gaza as part of Iran's \"axis of resistance\" to the US and Israel.\n\nAmong the most notable attacks, the Huthis stormed and hijacked a vehicle-carrier, the Galaxy Leader, in November, later opening it as a tourist attraction for propaganda purposes.\n\nIn March, the Rubymar bulk carrier, carrying thousands of tonnes of fertiliser, sank in the Red Sea after its hull was damaged in a Huthi missile strike.\n\nYemen's war has left hundreds of thousands of people dead, through fighting or indirect causes such as disease or lack of food, with most of the population dependent on aid.\n\nth/kir",

        "title": "G7 leaders tackle migration, AI and economic security on final day of summit",
        "body": "The G7 leaders stressed their determination to meet global challenges \"at a crucial moment in history\".\n\nThe gathering in a luxury resort in Italy's southern Puglia region also discussed other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, the war in Gaza, climate change, Iran, the situation in the Red Sea, gender equality and China's industrial policy and economic security.\n\n\"We are working together and with others to address the pressing challenges of our time,\" the G7 leaders said in a final statement, noting their solidarity with Ukraine, support for a deal that would lead to an immediate ceasefire and release of hostages in Gaza, investment in sustainable infrastructure in Africa and commitments to address climate change and migration.\n\nDivisions did emerge during the summit, however, notably over the lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final declaration.\n\nAsked if the G7 gathering has lived up to expectations, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"The aim of the G7 is to create convergence and be able to remove misunderstandings. It's not a place where you decide emergency measures or regulate things.\" He added that there were \"true convergences on Ukraine and Mideast\".\n\n\"It was a useful G7, with useful results,\" Mr Macron said. \"The coming weeks will create the conditions for political opportunities in particular around the two conflicts.\"\n\nMigration was the first topic of discussions on Friday, with the leaders mulling ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.\n\nThe issue is of particular interest to summit host Italy, which lies on one of the major routes into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her hardline stance on migration, has been eager to increase investment and funding for African nations as a means of reducing migratory pressure on Europe.\n\nThe leaders \"launched the G7 Coalition to prevent and counter the smuggling of migrants\", the summit's final declaration said, noting the seven nations would \"focus on the root causes of irregular migration, efforts to enhance border management and curb transnational organised crime, and safe and regular pathways for migration\".\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he and Ms Meloni - whom he described as \"fantastic\" - saw \"eye to eye\" on migration.\n\n\"We can't have criminal gangs decide who comes to our countries,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\nMs Meloni has a controversial five-year deal with neighbouring Albania for the Balkan country to host thousands of asylum seekers while Italy processes their claims. She has also spearheaded the \"Mattei Plan\" for Africa, a continent-wide strategy to increase economic opportunities at home and so discourage migration.\n\nFor its part, Britain has a deal to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, although no flights have yet taken off. Human rights organisations have criticised the agreement as unethical and unworkable.\n\nThe United States has also been struggling with a growing number of migrants. President Joe Biden introduced new policies to curb migration after a Bill he tried to get through Congress failed to pass. However, the future of the new policies is unclear after immigrant rights advocates challenged them with lawsuits.\n\nApart from the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, the Italian hosts also invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Ms Meloni's migration and development initiatives.\n\nBut rights groups decried what they said was a lack of ambition in support for developing countries.\n\nThe ONE Campaign, which advocates for investment in Africa, said it had found the G7 and EU institutions' share of aid going to Africa was at its lowest point since 1973.\n\n\"Without any concrete action, the G7 in Italy amounts to no more than pointless platitudes,\" said David McNair, executive director at The ONE Campaign.\n\nAlthough the summit's final statement \"reflects promises of increased partnership between the G7 and Africa, there are very few specifics on what new financing, if any, will be available\".\n\nPope Francis also became the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, delivering a speech on artificial intelligence. Other invitees included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe summit opened on Thursday with a strong show of support for Kyiv: an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion-dollar (£39.5 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denounced the freezing of Russian assets as \"theft\" and vowed it \"will not go unpunished\".\n\nMr Biden also signed a bilateral security agreement with Mr Zelensky, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv.\n\nBut some cracks appeared among the G7 leaders, notably Mr Macron deploring a lack of a reference to abortion in the summit's final document.\n\nThe statement after last year's summit in Hiroshima, Japan, expressed a commitment to provide access to safe and legal abortion to women and girls, and pledged to defend gender equality and the rights of members of the LGBT+ community.\n\nThe word \"abortion\" was absent from this year's final communique, although it included a reference to promoting sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\n\"It was not possible to reach agreement on these things in the room,\" a senior EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the private discussions.\n\nAsked on Thursday about reports that abortion would not be included in the final text, Mr Macron said it was something he regretted.\n\nFrance \"has included women's right to abortion, the freedom of decision on one's own body, into its constitution\", he said, adding that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men\".\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" Mr Macron said.\n\nMs Meloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has denied she is rolling back rights to abortions, which have been legal in Italy since 1978. But the centre-left opposition has warned that her initiatives are chipping away at those rights, including by giving pro-life groups access to women considering abortions.",

        "title": "Ramaphosa set for re-election in South Africa after coalition agreement",
        "body": "The deal, which parties referred to as a government of national unity, will bring the ANC together in government with the Democratic Alliance (DA), a white-led party that had for years been the main opposition and a fierce foe for the ANC.\n\nAt least two other smaller parties will also be part of the agreement that put South Africa into uncharted waters with the first national coalition government in its democratic history.\n\n\"The government of national unity is on track,\" ANC secretary-general Fikile Mbalula said. \"For the interest of the country, we said let's work together. We have no fear of that.\"\n\nThe agreement was necessary after the ANC lost its 30-year majority in a humbling national election for it last month. It was a turning point for Africa's most industrialised economy. The ANC is the party of Nelson Mandela and had governed with a comfortable majority ever since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994.\n\nThat three-decade dominance ended in the May 29 election, when the ANC's share of the vote dropped to 40% amid discontent from South Africans over high levels of poverty, inequality and unemployment.\n\nAll the parties have said they would put their differences aside to work in the best interests of the country.\n\nHowever, analysts warned there might be complications ahead given the starkly different ideologies of the ANC, a former liberation movement, and the centrist, business-friendly DA -- the two biggest parties and the key players. The DA won 21% of the vote in the national election, the second largest share.\n\nFor one, the DA disagreed with the ANC government's move to accuse Israel of genocide in Gaza in a highly sensitive case at the United Nations' top court.\n\nDA leader John Steenhuisen was the first to confirm that an agreement was dramatically signed on Friday when Parliament was in a break.\n\n\"From today, the DA will co-govern the Republic of South Africa in a spirit of unity and collaboration,\" Mr Steenhuisen said as he broke away from the proceedings to make a speech that was carried live on television. He called it an \"historic step forward.\"\n\nMr Steenhuisen said the DA would back the 71-year-old Mr Ramaphosa for president and because the two parties have a clear joint majority of seats in Parliament, Mr Ramaphosa's re-election now appeared to be assured.\n\nThe Parliament session first went through the hours-long swearing-in of hundreds of new MPs and electing a speaker and a deputy speaker, before the house set to vote on the president, well into the night. Two candidates were nominated -- Mr Ramaphosa and Julius Malema, the leader of the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters party which had refused to join the unity government.\n\nA majority of the votes cast in a secret ballot in the 400-member lower house of Parliament, called the National Assembly, was required to elect a president.\n\nFormer President Jacob Zuma's MK Party was boycotting the session, which did not after the voting as only a third of the house is needed for a quorum.\n\nParliament convened in an unusual setting after a fire in 2022 gutted the National Assembly building in Cape Town and lawmakers came together at a conference centre near the city's waterfront.\n\nTwo other smaller parties said they would be part of the coalition agreement and Mr Mbalula said the ANC was open to talking with anyone else who wanted to join the unity government.\n\nThere are 18 political parties represented in Parliament and Mr Mbalula said the multi-party agreement would \"prioritise the country across the political and ideological divide\". Some parties refused to join.\n\nThe other two parties to join were the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Patriotic Alliance, which has drawn attention because of its strong anti-immigration stance and because its leader, Gayton McKenzie, served a prison sentence for bank robbery.\n\n\"The deal is we are putting South Africa first,\" Mr McKenzie said in an interview on state broadcaster SABC. \"We are going to work together. We have decided we are not going to let South Africa die in our hands, on our watch.\"\n\nThe ANC had faced a deadline to get a coalition agreement given parliament had to sit for the first time and vote for the president within 14 days of the election results being declared on June 2.\n\nThe ANC had been trying to strike a coalition agreement for two weeks and the final negotiations went through the night Thursday and into Friday, party officials said.\n\nSouth Africa had not faced this level of political uncertainty since the ANC swept to power in the first all-race election in 1994 that ended nearly a half-century of racial segregation.\n\nThe party had held a clear majority in parliament since then, meaning parliamentary votes for the president were formalities and every South African leader since had been from the ANC, starting with Mr Mandela.\n\nThis unity government also harked back to the way Mr Mandela, South Africa's first black president, invited political opponents to be part of a new unity government in 1994 in an act of reconciliation. The ANC's hand was forced this time.\n\n\"The ANC has been very magnanimous in that they have accepted defeat and have said, 'let's talk',\" PA leader Mr McKenzie said.",

        "summary": "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is set for re-election following a historic coalition agreement between the African National Congress (ANC) and the Democratic Alliance (DA), along with two smaller parties, the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Patriotic Alliance. This coalition, termed a government of national unity, marks the first national coalition government in South Africa's democratic history. The agreement was necessitated after the ANC lost its 30-year majority in the recent national election, securing only 40% of the vote. The DA, which won 21% of the vote, has agreed to support Ramaphosa for president, ensuring his re-election given their combined majority in Parliament. The coalition aims to prioritize national interests despite differing ideologies, though analysts warn of potential complications. The agreement was finalized just before the parliamentary deadline, with the session held in a conference center due to a previous fire in the National Assembly building. This coalition echoes Nelson Mandela's inclusive approach in 1994 but was driven by the ANC's recent electoral defeat.",

        "body": "The United States on Friday announced another $315 million for hungry Sudanese as it pressed the warring sides to end obstruction of aid, warning that a famine of historic proportions could unfold without urgent action.\n\nThe assistance will include food and drinking water, as well as malnutrition emergency screening and treatment for children.\n\nIt comes as estimates say that five million people inside Sudan suffer extreme hunger, with food lacking also in neighboring countries where two million Sudanese have fled.\n\n\"We need the world to wake up to the catastrophe happening before our very eyes,\" Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters.\n\n\"We've seen mortality projections estimating that in excess of 2.5 million people -- about 15 percent of the population -- in Darfur and Kordofan, the hardest-hit regions, could die by the end of September,\" she said.\n\n\"This is the largest humanitarian crisis on the face of the planet, and yet somehow it threatens to get worse,\" she said, pointing to expectations that the key border crossing will become unpassable with the rainy season.\n\nA UN humanitarian appeal for Sudan has received only 16 percent of its target, with much global attention focused instead on Gaza, where aid workers have also warned of famine risks.\n\nSamantha Power, the administrator of the US Agency for International Development (USAID), said Sudan could be in worse shape than Somalia in 2011 when some 250,000 people died after three consecutive seasons without enough rain in a country grappling with near anarchy.\n\n\"The most worrying scenario would be that Sudan would become the deadliest famine since Ethiopia in the early 1980s,\" when as many as 1.2 million people died, she said.\n\nSudan descended into war in April 2023 when the generals in charge of the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) took up arms to seize control, rejecting a plan to integrate.\n\nWith the two sides battling for power across the country, Power said that deliveries of aid across the rival sides' lines of control was \"virtually non-existent.\"\n\nPower strongly criticized both sides. The RSF, she said, has been \"systematically looting humanitarian warehouses, stealing food and livestock, destroying grain storage facilities and wells in the most vulnerable Sudanese communities.\"\n\nThe army, in turn \"completely contradicts its commitments and its responsibility\" to the Sudanese people by blocking aid from crossing the border with Chad into Darfur, she said.\n\nMore from this section How Apple's AI Strategy Deviates from Microsoft and Google and What It Means for Users Christopher Hope defends GB News after backlash from Gina Miller: 'People who attack this channel just don't watch it!'

Sudan expelled diplomats from the United Arab Emirates on allegations of fueling the RSF, while Egypt, Turkey and Iran have backed the army.\n\nRecent fighting in El-Fasher, the last city in Darfur outside RSF control, has killed more than 220 people, according to charity Doctors Without Borders.\n\nThe UN Security Council on Thursday demanded that the RSF halt the siege, with all countries voting in favor except Russia, which abstained.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken late last month called Sudan's army chief, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and pressed both for humanitarian access and a resumption of diplomacy between the two sides.\n\nTalks last year in the Saudi port city of Jeddah, brokered by the United States and Saudi Arabia, only briefly paused fighting, and a US push to restart the process has been unsuccessful.\n\n\"We know that there is no acceptable military solution to this conflict,\" Thomas-Greenfield said.\n\n\"We have been disappointed with the delays.\"\n\nsct/st",

        "summary": "The United States has announced an additional $315 million in aid for Sudan, aimed at providing food, drinking water, and emergency malnutrition treatment for children. This comes amid warnings of a potential historic famine, with five million people in Sudan facing extreme hunger and two million refugees in neighboring countries also lacking food. US Ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, highlighted the severity of the crisis, particularly in Darfur and Kordofan, where mortality projections suggest up to 2.5 million people could die by the end of September.\n\nThe conflict in Sudan, which began in April 2023 between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), has severely hindered aid delivery. USAID Administrator Samantha Power criticized both sides for obstructing aid, with the RSF accused of looting and destroying resources, and the army blocking aid routes. Despite US-led diplomatic efforts, including calls from Secretary of State Antony Blinken and previous talks in Jeddah, the conflict persists with no military solution in sight. The UN Security Council has demanded the RSF halt its siege in Darfur, but diplomatic progress remains stalled.",

        "body": "A Republican senator has charged President Biden's interior secretary with showing \"political sympathy\" for pro-Hamas vandals by not cracking down on thousands of demonstrators who descended on the White House last weekend and marred monuments in the nation's capital.\n\nJohn Barrasso (R-Wyo.), the ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, told Interior Secretary Deb Haaland in a Thursday letter he was \"deeply troubled\" by the \"clear acts of violence and vandalism\" committed by \"pro-terror, anti-Israel agitators.\"\n\n\"Disturbingly, police reported no arrests following protesters' clear acts of violence and vandalism, leaving many questions unanswered about the adequacy of the response to this incident,\" he told Haaland.\n\n\"I question whether political sympathy with the agitators influenced your department's response to these acts of violence and vandalism.\"\n\nThousands of jihadi supporters defaced statues of the French military leaders Comte de Rochambeau and Marquis de Lafayette, who aided the Continental Army and George Washington in defeating the British during the Revolutionary War.\n\nAnother statue of former US President Andrew Jackson was also vandalized after almost being toppled by demonstrators four years before during rioting following the death of George Floyd.\n\n\"Death to AmeriKKKa\" the protesters scrawled on the statues, along with \"Long live Hamas\" and \"Muslims 4 Hamas.\"\n\nAdditional fencing had been erected by federal authorities to protect the executive mansion ahead of the demonstration.\n\nPresident Biden was not in Washington at the time, but was in France for commemorations of the 80th anniversary of D-Day.\n\nNeither the Metropolitan Police Department nor the US Secret Service reported any arrests in the immediate aftermath, according to the Washington Free Beacon and Washington Post.\n\nThe National Park Service (NPS) has also not yet assessed the total damages to monuments and other property.\n\nA spokesperson for Metro Police confirmed on Friday that \"no arrests\" had been made \"related to the protests near the White House.\"\n\nThe National Park Service and Secret Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nOne of the groups organizing the protest, the ANSWER Coalition, accused Biden of crossing a \"red line\" by allowing Israel to invade Rafah, the last stronghold of Hamas, and called for an immediate cease-fire and end to US funding for Israel's war against the terror group.\n\nBiden, 81, paused a weapons shipment to Israel and administration officials have pushed for a cease-fire -- while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stood firm on the need to eliminate Hamas from Gaza before concluding the war.\n\nThe wartime decisions come as the president faces an uphill battle to re-election in 2024, with tens of thousands of \"uncommitted\" voters in battleground states opposing him over his administration's support for Israel.\n\nAlso on Thursday, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) introduced a bill to enforce mandatory minimum prison sentences on vandals who mar statues and destroy other federal property.\n\n\"These overt criminal acts, committed on your watch, necessitate your unequivocal condemnation and decisive action to help bring these agitators to justice,\" Barrasso scolded Haaland in his letter.\n\n\"As the Secretary of the Interior, your support of the [US Park Police] and National Park Service is paramount to the security of our federal lands,\" he said. \"The brazen assaults and subsequent vandalism are stark reminders of the vulnerabilities faced by law enforcement officers and rangers who serve and protect our national treasures.\"\n\n\"Your strong and immediate response is essential in affirming our national commitment to the rule of law and the safety of our federal personnel and properties,\" the Republican added.\n\nBarrasso has asked for the Interior Department to answer questions about its coordination with other local and federal law enforcement departments to hold the vandals accountable and ensure the future safety of park rangers -- at least one of whom was assaulted during the protest.\n\nWhen offered the opportunity to respond to Barrasso Friday, an Interior Department spokesperson told The Post: \"No, thank you.\"",

        "body": "It is now clear all manner of antisemitic sins can be indulged under the guise of opposing Zionism.\n\nOn Monday, Within Our Lifetime, a militant pro-Palestinian group that refuses to condemn Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attack, led protests outside a Lower Manhattan exhibition about the massacre at the Nova Music Festival. They set off smoke bombs; a few carried Hamas and Hezbollah flags; others held signs saying \"Long live Oct. 7th.\"\n\nOn the subway that same night, in a filmed interaction that went viral, protesters leaving that demonstration asked any Zionists to identify themselves and leave the subway car, saying \"This is your chance to get out.\" One man wearing a t-shirt with the Hezbollah flag on it harassed a passenger who was wearing a kippah, saying, \"Yo we got a Zionist here I see your kippah. You're not really Jewish,\" and \"We're gonna find you and you'll face the consequences.\"\n\nWithin 24 hours, vandals defaced the home of Anne Pasternak, the Jewish director of the Brooklyn Museum, along with three museum board members. Red paint and upside-down red triangles -- a symbol lifted directly from Hamas' armed Al-Qassam brigade videos, which use the inverted red triangle emoji to mark Israeli targets -- were splashed on their homes' facades and front doors. A sign was hung across Pasternak's home labeling her a \"White-Supremacist Zionist.\"\n\nWhat all these events made clear: Among those protesting the war, a clear subset is using \"Zionist\" as a catchall for \"Jew.\"\n\nThe speed at which blatant antisemitic bigotry appears to have become wrapped up in the package of opposing Zionism is breathtaking. So is the number of intelligent people, normally highly attuned to injustice, who are ignoring it.\n\nThere have always been those who use these terms interchangeably. What's new is the boldness of those using it, and the distinction between Jews -- a marginalized group worthy of respect -- and Zionists -- worthy targets of violence.\n\n\"Zionists are not Jews and not humans\" read a sign from protesters outside the Nova exhibit.\n\nThe survivors of the Nova at the exhibition? It's ok to retraumatize them, because they're Zionists, not Jews.\n\nIt's fine to threaten subway passengers who are peacefully minding their own business, because if they're wearing kippahs, they must be Zionists.\n\nA Jewish museum director, whose home was targeted with a symbol used by a terrorist group to mark their victims? It's fine, we don't need to worry about her safety, because she's a Zionist. (Pasternak's friends say she has a long history of pro-Palestinian advocacy.)\n\nWhat it boils down to: If we call you a Zionist, you deserve the consequences -- whether they're public threats, an invasion of your private life, or pure harassment. And if that behavior crosses the line from peaceful protest to aggressive antisemitism, well, Zionists deserve that too.\n\nWorse still, these shifts have been broadly accompanied by an utter lack of accountability from anyone who counts themselves as pro-Palestine when it comes to disavowing this vile behavior. That silence tarnishes a very just movement to liberate Palestinians from decades of Israeli occupation.\n\nThe events of this week are obvious bigotry. But I'm not seeing my progressive friends post about it online. I'm not seeing the non-Jewish authors, journalists, activists and lawyers that I so deeply admire for their advocacy on trans rights, immigration, racial justice and criminal justice reform speak up and call out this appropriation of anti-Zionism to mask antisemitism.\n\nI'm not seeing my well-meaning friends who rightfully speak up about the racism of Jewish settlers destroying aid convoys for Gaza, and violently expelling Palestinians from their villages in the West Bank, also condemn this festering hatred present in the pro-Palestinian movement.\n\nTo be clear, sometimes anti-Zionism is not antisemitic. But sometimes it is.\n\nI recently saw a post on Instagram about the author's volunteer efforts to get her block in Brooklyn designated as a landmark, in an effort to protect elderly Black homeowners from predatory landlords. In sharing the many obstacles the volunteers had overcome, my eye caught this line: \"We have experienced Zionism first hand and it has been terrifying and taxing.\"\n\nUmm... what?\n\nI quickly scanned the rest of the post. Zionism popped up again: \"To be preserving Black Bedstuy in the face of Zionism. At a time when our world needs to be free of it!!\"\n\nThere are innumerable definitions of Zionism, but none of them remotely encompass efforts to alter a neighborhood in Brooklyn. Gentrification and displacement are very real phenomena that disproportionately affect Black and brown people, but they have nothing to do with Jewish self-determination.\n\nThe most likely scenario: This person interacted with a Jewish landlord or Jewish-owned management company in their conservation battle. And while scummy landlords are the worst -- I've lived in New York City for 13 years, I know -- they come in all ethnicities and religions.\n\nThese sentences were straight-up, indisputable antisemitism, but the likes and \"Congrats!\" and \"Good work sis!\" cascaded onto the post, including from a journalist who works at The New York Times. The author had also tagged a New York City Council member who had aided their group.\n\nThe protests outside the Nova exhibition and the vandalism of Brooklyn Museum executives' homes were universally decried by politicians across the political spectrum, most notably by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has not always pleased the Jewish community with her advocacy against arming Israel. (Ocasio-Cortez, who encountered severe blowback from progressives and accusations of being a paid shill for AIPAC after speaking out against antisemitism in a livestream earlier this week, is now seeing the consequences of calling out the moments when anti-Zionism is antisemitism.)\n\nBy not uniformly condemning these bad actors within the movement, supporters of Palestinian liberation are tanking their movement's credibility, and giving ammunition to militant pro-Israel advocates who seek to discredit the entire project by dismissing it as antisemitic. How can anyone take a group like Within Our Lifetime seriously as a liberation movement, when people protesting with it say \"Zionists are not Jews and not human\"? When it chooses to protest not outside the Israeli consulate, but at a memorial to victims of terror?\n\nThe collapse of Zionism as a useful or effective definition began long ago. In an op-ed for the Forward early this year, Lux Alptraum pointed out how the semantics of how the term is used can obscure shared values. \"If two people can agree that they want peace and freedom for both Palestinians and Israelis,\" she wrote, \"does it matter if one of them identifies as Zionist and the other anti-Zionist?\" Tamar Glezerman, the Israeli-American co-founder of Israelis for Peace whose aunt was murdered at Kibbutz Be'eri on Oct. 7, told The Guardian that the term \"Zionist,\" as it's currently used, \"could mean anything between someone who believes in two states coexisting peacefully to code for Jews who don't deserve safety or life.\"\n\nThe slipperiness of who a \"Zionist\" is has allowed for antisemitic rhetoric and violence to flourish. How far will it have to go until self-proclaimed allies of Jews call it out?",

        "summary": "The article discusses the alarming trend of antisemitism being masked as anti-Zionism. It highlights recent events where this has been evident, including protests led by the pro-Palestinian group Within Our Lifetime, which refused to condemn Hamas' October 7 attack. These protests involved setting off smoke bombs, displaying Hamas and Hezbollah flags, and harassing individuals perceived as Zionists, including a man wearing a kippah on the subway.\n\nAdditionally, the homes of Anne Pasternak, the Jewish director of the Brooklyn Museum, and three board members were vandalized with symbols associated with Hamas, labeling them as \"White-Supremacist Zionists.\" The article argues that the term \"Zionist\" is increasingly being used as a catchall for \"Jew,\" leading to blatant antisemitic actions being justified under the guise of opposing Zionism.\n\nThe author criticizes the lack of accountability and condemnation from progressive circles and pro-Palestinian advocates regarding these antisemitic actions. The article underscores the danger of conflating anti-Zionism with antisemitism and calls for a clear distinction and condemnation of antisemitic behavior within the pro-Palestinian movement. It also notes the broader implications for the credibility of the Palestinian liberation movement and the potential for it to be discredited as antisemitic.",

        "title": "US punishes Israeli extremists accused of blocking, ransacking humanitarian aid for Gaza",
        "body": "WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration Friday took the unusual step of blacklisting a group of Israelis implicated in the looting and destroying of life-saving humanitarian aid destined for Palestinians trapped in the Gaza Strip after eight months of brutal war.\n\nIt is only the second time in recent years the U.S. has punished Israeli groups for their violent and sometimes deadly actions against Palestinians.\n\nLast year, the State Department announced it was banning U.S. entry to dozens of Jewish Israeli settlers who attacked Palestinian villagers in the West Bank, destroyed their properties and attempted to seize their land.\n\nSeveral hundred Palestinians in the West Bank have been killed in recent months in these attacks as well as in operations by the Israeli military.\n\nThe latest U.S. measure targets a group known as Tzav 9, Hebrew for \"Order 9,\" a reference to call-up orders for Israeli reservists. U.S. officials say the group has ties to extremist Jewish settlers in West Bank settlements.\n\n\"For months, individuals from Tzav 9 have repeatedly sought to thwart the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza, including by blockading roads, sometimes violently, along their route from Jordan to Gaza, including in the West Bank,\" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement. \"They also have damaged aid trucks and dumped life-saving humanitarian aid onto the road.\"\n\nThey have also burned aid trucks, he said. \"We will not tolerate acts of sabotage and violence targeting this essential humanitarian assistance,\" Miller said.\n\nWith negotiations for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war still unsuccessful, the inability of international organizations to get food, water and medicine into Gaza has deepened the suffering there, with more than one million Palestinians facing starvation. Aid agencies report that children are dying from malnutrition, and hundreds of people are dying from lack of medical care. Most hospitals have been rendered inoperable due to Israeli bombardment.\n\nIsrael last month closed the Rafah crossing on Gaza's border with Egypt, a principal entry point for aid. The U.S. military built a pier into Gaza's coast for aid deliveries, but it has been plagued by high seas and other problems that have limited its ability to deliver aid.\n\nTzav 9 claims it is stopping \"gifts\" from reaching Hamas, the militant group in Gaza whose attack on kibbutzim and a musical festival in southern Israel on Oct. 7 left nearly 1,200 Israelis and others dead and triggered the current war.\n\nAt times Israeli extremists have filmed themselves in the act of blocking trucks, destroying cargo and dumping aid in the road.\n\nMore than 36,000 Palestinians - many civilians - have been killed by Israel's air and land operations in Gaza as of May 31.\n\nIt is not clear what impact the new sanctions will have on the group. The measures bar members of the sanctioned group from financial transactions with American persons or entities, and may impede their travel to the U.S. Any assets they have in the U.S. would be frozen.\n\nThe State Department also called out the Israeli government, noting it was Israel's \"responsibility to ensure the safety and security of humanitarian convoys transiting Israel and the West Bank en route to Gaza.\n\nFriday's action comes in part in response to an urgent plea from Jordan, which has been supplying most of the targeted aid trucks. Jordan has been able to dispatch up to 40 trucks a day to Gaza. It is a tiny fraction of what aid workers say is the bare necessity.\n\n©2024 Los Angeles Times. Visit at latimes.com.

        "body": "The deal, which parties referred to as a government of national unity, will bring the ANC together in government with the Democratic Alliance (DA), a white-led party that had for years been the main opposition and a fierce foe for the ANC.\n\nAt least two other smaller parties will also be part of the agreement that put South Africa into uncharted waters with the first national coalition government in its democratic history.\n\n\"The government of national unity is on track,\" ANC secretary-general Fikile Mbalula said. \"For the interest of the country, we said let's work together. We have no fear of that.\"\n\nThe agreement was necessary after the ANC lost its 30-year majority in a humbling national election for it last month. It was a turning point for Africa's most industrialised economy. The ANC is the party of Nelson Mandela and had governed with a comfortable majority ever since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994.\n\nThat three-decade dominance ended in the May 29 election, when the ANC's share of the vote dropped to 40% amid discontent from South Africans over high levels of poverty, inequality and unemployment.\n\nAll the parties have said they would put their differences aside to work in the best interests of the country.\n\nHowever, analysts warned there might be complications ahead given the starkly different ideologies of the ANC, a former liberation movement, and the centrist, business-friendly DA -- the two biggest parties and the key players. The DA won 21% of the vote in the national election, the second largest share.\n\nFor one, the DA disagreed with the ANC government's move to accuse Israel of genocide in Gaza in a highly sensitive case at the United Nations' top court.\n\nDA leader John Steenhuisen was the first to confirm that an agreement was dramatically signed on Friday when Parliament was in a break.\n\n\"From today, the DA will co-govern the Republic of South Africa in a spirit of unity and collaboration,\" Mr Steenhuisen said as he broke away from the proceedings to make a speech that was carried live on television. He called it an \"historic step forward.\"\n\nMr Steenhuisen said the DA would back the 71-year-old Mr Ramaphosa for president and because the two parties have a clear joint majority of seats in Parliament, Mr Ramaphosa's re-election now appeared to be assured.\n\nThe Parliament session first went through the hours-long swearing-in of hundreds of new MPs and electing a speaker and a deputy speaker, before the house set to vote on the president, well into the night. Two candidates were nominated -- Mr Ramaphosa and Julius Malema, the leader of the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters party which had refused to join the unity government.\n\nA majority of the votes cast in a secret ballot in the 400-member lower house of Parliament, called the National Assembly, was required to elect a president.\n\nFormer President Jacob Zuma's MK Party was boycotting the session, which did not after the voting as only a third of the house is needed for a quorum.\n\nParliament convened in an unusual setting after a fire in 2022 gutted the National Assembly building in Cape Town and lawmakers came together at a conference centre near the city's waterfront.\n\nTwo other smaller parties said they would be part of the coalition agreement and Mr Mbalula said the ANC was open to talking with anyone else who wanted to join the unity government.\n\nThere are 18 political parties represented in Parliament and Mr Mbalula said the multi-party agreement would \"prioritise the country across the political and ideological divide\". Some parties refused to join.\n\nThe other two parties to join were the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Patriotic Alliance, which has drawn attention because of its strong anti-immigration stance and because its leader, Gayton McKenzie, served a prison sentence for bank robbery.\n\n\"The deal is we are putting South Africa first,\" Mr McKenzie said in an interview on state broadcaster SABC. \"We are going to work together. We have decided we are not going to let South Africa die in our hands, on our watch.\"\n\nThe ANC had faced a deadline to get a coalition agreement given parliament had to sit for the first time and vote for the president within 14 days of the election results being declared on June 2.\n\nThe ANC had been trying to strike a coalition agreement for two weeks and the final negotiations went through the night Thursday and into Friday, party officials said.\n\nSouth Africa had not faced this level of political uncertainty since the ANC swept to power in the first all-race election in 1994 that ended nearly a half-century of racial segregation.\n\nThe party had held a clear majority in parliament since then, meaning parliamentary votes for the president were formalities and every South African leader since had been from the ANC, starting with Mr Mandela.\n\nThis unity government also harked back to the way Mr Mandela, South Africa's first black president, invited political opponents to be part of a new unity government in 1994 in an act of reconciliation. The ANC's hand was forced this time.\n\n\"The ANC has been very magnanimous in that they have accepted defeat and have said, 'let's talk',\" PA leader Mr McKenzie said.",

This coalition forms the first national unity government in South Africa's democratic history, necessitated by the ANC losing its 30-year majority in the recent election, where it garnered only 40% of the vote. The DA, which secured 21%, has agreed to support Ramaphosa for president. Despite ideological differences, the parties have committed to working together for the country's benefit. The coalition agreement was finalized just before the parliamentary session, which included the swearing-in of new MPs and the election of a speaker and deputy speaker. The session took place in a conference center due to a fire that damaged the National Assembly building. The ANC's coalition efforts were driven by a deadline to elect a president within 14 days of the election results. This political shift marks a significant moment of uncertainty and change in South Africa's political landscape.",

        "body": "ATC Acquires Majority Stake in Raw Power to Form UK Artist Management 'Powerhouse'\n\nBarclays has suspended its sponsorship of Live Nation's U.K. festivals following protests from artists over the bank's links to defense companies supplying arms to Israel as well as fossil fuel firms.\n\nCountry singer CMAT, folk group Lankum and rock bands Pest Control, Zulu, Scowl, Speed and Ithaca are among the acts who have either pulled out of or threatened to boycott Live Nation-promoted summer events, including July's Latitude festival and the three-day Download festival, which starts Friday (June 14) in Donington Park, Leicestershire.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, a spokesperson for Live Nation U.K. said, \"Following discussion with artists, we have agreed with Barclays that they will step back from sponsorship of our festivals.\"\n\nConfirming the news, a spokesperson for Barclays told Billboard that the London-headquartered bank \"was asked and has agreed to suspend participation in the remaining Live Nation festivals in 2024.\"\n\n\"Barclays customers who hold tickets to these festivals are not affected and their tickets remain valid,\" the spokesperson continued. \"The protestors' agenda is to have Barclays debank defence companies which is a sector we remain committed to as an essential part of keeping this country and our allies safe.\"\n\nReferencing recent outbreaks of vandalism at a number of U.K. Barclays bank branches, where protestors threw paint and smashed windows, the spokesperson said the \"only thing that this small group of activists will achieve is to weaken essential support for cultural events enjoyed by millions. It is time that leaders across politics, business, academia and the arts stand united against this.\"\n\nBarclays is one of the biggest sponsors of music festivals in the United Kingdom and signed a five-year sponsorship deal with Live Nation last year. Over the past two decades, the company says it has invested £112 million ($142 million) in supporting British music and the country's arts sector.\n\nPressure from pro-Palestinian groups on music festivals and arts organizations to cut ties with sponsors with perceived links to Israel has been building since the start of the conflict in Gaza. Last month, more than 150 artists withdrew from Brighton's Great Escape Festival over the independent event's ties to Barclays.\n\nDefending its position, Barclays has previously stated that it provides \"vital financial services to U.S., U.K. and European public companies that supply defence products to NATO and its allies\" but does not directly invest in these companies.\n\nThe news that the international bank, which has also drawn heavy criticism from environmental campaigners for bankrolling fossil fuel firms, was pulling out of sponsoring Live Nation's U.K. festivals was welcomed by campaign group Bands Boycott Barclays.\n\n\"As musicians, we were horrified that our music festivals were partnered with Barclays, who are complicit in the genocide in Gaza through investment, loans and underwriting of arms companies supplying the Israeli military,\" posted the campaign group on Instagram.\n\n\"Hundreds of artists have taken action this summer to make it clear that this is morally reprehensible, and we are glad we have been heard,\" the group added.\n\nPosting on X, Rage Against The Machine's Tom Morello, who is due to play Download this weekend, said that \"the fact that the festival has listened to its musicians and cut ties with Barclays Bank is a testament to the power of artists taking collective action for human rights.\"\n\n\"I've been pushing hard for this behind the scenes,\" added Morello, \"and I salute all the artists like Zulu, Scowl and Speed who have taken a stand to help make this historic withdrawal happen.\"",

        "body": "The deal, which parties referred to as a government of national unity, will bring the ANC together in government with the Democratic Alliance (DA), a white-led party that had for years been the main opposition and a fierce foe for the ANC.\n\nAt least two other smaller parties will also be part of the agreement that put South Africa into uncharted waters with the first national coalition government in its democratic history.\n\n\"The government of national unity is on track,\" ANC secretary-general Fikile Mbalula said. \"For the interest of the country, we said let's work together. We have no fear of that.\"\n\nThe agreement was necessary after the ANC lost its 30-year majority in a humbling national election for it last month. It was a turning point for Africa's most industrialised economy. The ANC is the party of Nelson Mandela and had governed with a comfortable majority ever since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994.\n\nThat three-decade dominance ended in the May 29 election, when the ANC's share of the vote dropped to 40% amid discontent from South Africans over high levels of poverty, inequality and unemployment.\n\nAll the parties have said they would put their differences aside to work in the best interests of the country.\n\nHowever, analysts warned there might be complications ahead given the starkly different ideologies of the ANC, a former liberation movement, and the centrist, business-friendly DA -- the two biggest parties and the key players. The DA won 21% of the vote in the national election, the second largest share.\n\nFor one, the DA disagreed with the ANC government's move to accuse Israel of genocide in Gaza in a highly sensitive case at the United Nations' top court.\n\nDA leader John Steenhuisen was the first to confirm that an agreement was dramatically signed on Friday when Parliament was in a break.\n\n\"From today, the DA will co-govern the Republic of South Africa in a spirit of unity and collaboration,\" Mr Steenhuisen said as he broke away from the proceedings to make a speech that was carried live on television. He called it an \"historic step forward.\"\n\nMr Steenhuisen said the DA would back the 71-year-old Mr Ramaphosa for president and because the two parties have a clear joint majority of seats in Parliament, Mr Ramaphosa's re-election now appeared to be assured.\n\nThe Parliament session first went through the hours-long swearing-in of hundreds of new MPs and electing a speaker and a deputy speaker, before the house set to vote on the president, well into the night. Two candidates were nominated -- Mr Ramaphosa and Julius Malema, the leader of the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters party which had refused to join the unity government.\n\nA majority of the votes cast in a secret ballot in the 400-member lower house of Parliament, called the National Assembly, was required to elect a president.\n\nFormer President Jacob Zuma's MK Party was boycotting the session, which did not after the voting as only a third of the house is needed for a quorum.\n\nParliament convened in an unusual setting after a fire in 2022 gutted the National Assembly building in Cape Town and lawmakers came together at a conference centre near the city's waterfront.\n\nTwo other smaller parties said they would be part of the coalition agreement and Mr Mbalula said the ANC was open to talking with anyone else who wanted to join the unity government.\n\nThere are 18 political parties represented in Parliament and Mr Mbalula said the multi-party agreement would \"prioritise the country across the political and ideological divide\". Some parties refused to join.\n\nThe other two parties to join were the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Patriotic Alliance, which has drawn attention because of its strong anti-immigration stance and because its leader, Gayton McKenzie, served a prison sentence for bank robbery.\n\n\"The deal is we are putting South Africa first,\" Mr McKenzie said in an interview on state broadcaster SABC. \"We are going to work together. We have decided we are not going to let South Africa die in our hands, on our watch.\"\n\nThe ANC had faced a deadline to get a coalition agreement given parliament had to sit for the first time and vote for the president within 14 days of the election results being declared on June 2.\n\nThe ANC had been trying to strike a coalition agreement for two weeks and the final negotiations went through the night Thursday and into Friday, party officials said.\n\nSouth Africa had not faced this level of political uncertainty since the ANC swept to power in the first all-race election in 1994 that ended nearly a half-century of racial segregation.\n\nThe party had held a clear majority in parliament since then, meaning parliamentary votes for the president were formalities and every South African leader since had been from the ANC, starting with Mr Mandela.\n\nThis unity government also harked back to the way Mr Mandela, South Africa's first black president, invited political opponents to be part of a new unity government in 1994 in an act of reconciliation. The ANC's hand was forced this time.\n\n\"The ANC has been very magnanimous in that they have accepted defeat and have said, 'let's talk',\" PA leader Mr McKenzie said.",

        "summary": "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is set for re-election following a historic coalition agreement between the African National Congress (ANC) and the Democratic Alliance (DA), along with at least two smaller parties. This coalition, termed a \"government of national unity,\" marks the first national coalition government in South Africa's democratic history. The agreement was necessitated after the ANC lost its 30-year majority in the recent national election, securing only 40% of the vote. The DA, which won 21% of the vote, has agreed to support Ramaphosa for president, ensuring his re-election due to their combined majority in Parliament.\n\nKey figures include ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula, DA leader John Steenhuisen, and leaders from the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Patriotic Alliance. The coalition aims to prioritize national interests despite differing ideologies, with the DA and ANC having significant policy disagreements, such as on the issue of Israel and Gaza.\n\nThe coalition agreement was finalized just before the parliamentary deadline, following intense negotiations. Parliament convened in a temporary location due to a fire in 2022 that damaged the National Assembly building. The session included the swearing-in of new MPs and the election of parliamentary leaders before the presidential vote. The Economic Freedom Fighters party, led by Julius Malema, refused to join the coalition, and former President Jacob Zuma's MK Party boycotted the session.\n\nThis coalition government is reminiscent of Nelson Mandela's inclusive approach in 1994 but was driven by the ANC's recent electoral defeat. The agreement aims to address South Africa's pressing issues of poverty, inequality, and unemployment.",

Two people were arrested by gardaí investigating a number of instances of assault, dangerous driving and criminal damage that occurred on Main Street in Ballymore Eustace on Wednesday evening. The President of University of Limerick announced she would resign after a series of controversies centring around a property deal that has come under heavy scrutiny. A man was convicted of conspiring to pervert the course of justice during Aaron Brady's trial for the murder of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe. Enoch Burke asked the High Court to set aside what he claims is the \"gravely flawed\" and \"unsound\" order underpinning his ongoing incarceration at Mountjoy Prison. Three women who pleaded guilty for witholding information and other offences in connection with the death of showjumper Katie Simpson were handed suspended sentences. Gardaí charged a woman in her thirties who was arrested this afternoon as part of the investigation into the murder of Michael Foley in Cork in February. A court heard that a woman who falsely claimed the pension of her dead father-in-law for almost 30 years got her husband to get into bed and pretend to be her 110-year old relative when Department of Social Protection officials called to her home.

        "body": "The deal, which parties referred to as a government of national unity, will bring the ANC together in government with the Democratic Alliance (DA), a white-led party that had for years been the main opposition and a fierce foe for the ANC.\n\nAt least two other smaller parties will also be part of the agreement that put South Africa into uncharted waters with the first national coalition government in its democratic history.\n\n\"The government of national unity is on track,\" ANC secretary-general Fikile Mbalula said. \"For the interest of the country, we said let's work together. We have no fear of that.\"\n\nThe agreement was necessary after the ANC lost its 30-year majority in a humbling national election for it last month. It was a turning point for Africa's most industrialised economy. The ANC is the party of Nelson Mandela and had governed with a comfortable majority ever since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994.\n\nThat three-decade dominance ended in the May 29 election, when the ANC's share of the vote dropped to 40% amid discontent from South Africans over high levels of poverty, inequality and unemployment.\n\nAll the parties have said they would put their differences aside to work in the best interests of the country.\n\nHowever, analysts warned there might be complications ahead given the starkly different ideologies of the ANC, a former liberation movement, and the centrist, business-friendly DA -- the two biggest parties and the key players. The DA won 21% of the vote in the national election, the second largest share.\n\nFor one, the DA disagreed with the ANC government's move to accuse Israel of genocide in Gaza in a highly sensitive case at the United Nations' top court.\n\nDA leader John Steenhuisen was the first to confirm that an agreement was dramatically signed on Friday when Parliament was in a break.\n\n\"From today, the DA will co-govern the Republic of South Africa in a spirit of unity and collaboration,\" Mr Steenhuisen said as he broke away from the proceedings to make a speech that was carried live on television. He called it an \"historic step forward.\"\n\nMr Steenhuisen said the DA would back the 71-year-old Mr Ramaphosa for president and because the two parties have a clear joint majority of seats in Parliament, Mr Ramaphosa's re-election now appeared to be assured.\n\nThe Parliament session first went through the hours-long swearing-in of hundreds of new MPs and electing a speaker and a deputy speaker, before the house set to vote on the president, well into the night. Two candidates were nominated -- Mr Ramaphosa and Julius Malema, the leader of the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters party which had refused to join the unity government.\n\nA majority of the votes cast in a secret ballot in the 400-member lower house of Parliament, called the National Assembly, was required to elect a president.\n\nFormer President Jacob Zuma's MK Party was boycotting the session, which did not after the voting as only a third of the house is needed for a quorum.\n\nParliament convened in an unusual setting after a fire in 2022 gutted the National Assembly building in Cape Town and lawmakers came together at a conference centre near the city's waterfront.\n\nTwo other smaller parties said they would be part of the coalition agreement and Mr Mbalula said the ANC was open to talking with anyone else who wanted to join the unity government.\n\nThere are 18 political parties represented in Parliament and Mr Mbalula said the multi-party agreement would \"prioritise the country across the political and ideological divide\". Some parties refused to join.\n\nThe other two parties to join were the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Patriotic Alliance, which has drawn attention because of its strong anti-immigration stance and because its leader, Gayton McKenzie, served a prison sentence for bank robbery.\n\n\"The deal is we are putting South Africa first,\" Mr McKenzie said in an interview on state broadcaster SABC. \"We are going to work together. We have decided we are not going to let South Africa die in our hands, on our watch.\"\n\nThe ANC had faced a deadline to get a coalition agreement given parliament had to sit for the first time and vote for the president within 14 days of the election results being declared on June 2.\n\nThe ANC had been trying to strike a coalition agreement for two weeks and the final negotiations went through the night Thursday and into Friday, party officials said.\n\nSouth Africa had not faced this level of political uncertainty since the ANC swept to power in the first all-race election in 1994 that ended nearly a half-century of racial segregation.\n\nThe party had held a clear majority in parliament since then, meaning parliamentary votes for the president were formalities and every South African leader since had been from the ANC, starting with Mr Mandela.\n\nThis unity government also harked back to the way Mr Mandela, South Africa's first black president, invited political opponents to be part of a new unity government in 1994 in an act of reconciliation. The ANC's hand was forced this time.\n\n\"The ANC has been very magnanimous in that they have accepted defeat and have said, 'let's talk',\" PA leader Mr McKenzie said.",

        "summary": "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is set for re-election following a historic coalition agreement between the African National Congress (ANC) and the Democratic Alliance (DA), along with two smaller parties, the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Patriotic Alliance. This coalition, termed a government of national unity, marks the first national coalition government in South Africa's democratic history. The agreement was necessitated after the ANC lost its 30-year majority in the recent national election, securing only 40% of the vote. The DA, which won 21% of the vote, has agreed to support Ramaphosa for president, ensuring his re-election due to their combined majority in Parliament. The coalition aims to prioritize national interests despite differing ideologies, though analysts warn of potential complications. The agreement was finalized just before the parliamentary deadline, with the session held in a conference center due to a previous fire in the National Assembly building. This coalition echoes Nelson Mandela's inclusive approach in 1994 but was driven by the ANC's electoral defeat.",

He called it an \"historic step forward.\"\n\nMr Steenhuisen said the DA would back the 71-year-old Mr Ramaphosa for president and because the two parties have a clear joint majority of seats in Parliament, Mr Ramaphosa's re-election now appeared to be assured.\n\nThe Parliament session first went through the hours-long swearing-in of hundreds of new MPs and electing a speaker and a deputy speaker, before the house set to vote on the president, well into the night. Two candidates were nominated -- Mr Ramaphosa and Julius Malema, the leader of the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters party which had refused to join the unity government.\n\nA majority of the votes cast in a secret ballot in the 400-member lower house of Parliament, called the National Assembly, was required to elect a president.\n\nFormer President Jacob Zuma's MK Party was boycotting the session, which did not after the voting as only a third of the house is needed for a quorum.\n\nParliament convened in an unusual setting after a fire in 2022 gutted the National Assembly building in Cape Town and lawmakers came together at a conference centre near the city's waterfront.\n\nTwo other smaller parties said they would be part of the coalition agreement and Mr Mbalula said the ANC was open to talking with anyone else who wanted to join the unity government.\n\nThere are 18 political parties represented in Parliament and Mr Mbalula said the multi-party agreement would \"prioritise the country across the political and ideological divide\". Some parties refused to join.\n\nThe other two parties to join were the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Patriotic Alliance, which has drawn attention because of its strong anti-immigration stance and because its leader, Gayton McKenzie, served a prison sentence for bank robbery.\n\n\"The deal is we are putting South Africa first,\" Mr McKenzie said in an interview on state broadcaster SABC. \"We are going to work together. We have decided we are not going to let South Africa die in our hands, on our watch.\"\n\nThe ANC had faced a deadline to get a coalition agreement given parliament had to sit for the first time and vote for the president within 14 days of the election results being declared on June 2.\n\nThe ANC had been trying to strike a coalition agreement for two weeks and the final negotiations went through the night Thursday and into Friday, party officials said.\n\nSouth Africa had not faced this level of political uncertainty since the ANC swept to power in the first all-race election in 1994 that ended nearly a half-century of racial segregation.\n\nThe party had held a clear majority in parliament since then, meaning parliamentary votes for the president were formalities and every South African leader since had been from the ANC, starting with Mr Mandela.\n\nThis unity government also harked back to the way Mr Mandela, South Africa's first black president, invited political opponents to be part of a new unity government in 1994 in an act of reconciliation. The ANC's hand was forced this time.\n\n\"The ANC has been very magnanimous in that they have accepted defeat and have said, 'let's talk',\" PA leader Mr McKenzie said.",

        "summary": "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is set for re-election following a historic coalition agreement between the African National Congress (ANC) and the Democratic Alliance (DA), along with two smaller parties, the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Patriotic Alliance. This coalition forms South Africa's first national unity government since the end of apartheid. The agreement was necessary after the ANC lost its 30-year majority in the recent national election, securing only 40% of the vote. The DA, which won 21%, will now co-govern with the ANC. Despite ideological differences, both parties have committed to working together for the country's benefit. The coalition ensures Ramaphosa's re-election as the two parties hold a majority in Parliament. The session, held in a conference center due to a fire in the National Assembly building, saw the swearing-in of new MPs and the election of parliamentary leaders. The coalition aims to prioritize national interests, though some parties have refused to join. This political shift marks a significant moment in South Africa's democratic history.",

        "title": "US Sanctions Israeli Activists Accused of Attacking Humanitarian Aid Deliveries to Gaza",
        "body": "President Joe Biden's administration announced sanctions on Friday against an Israeli activist group blocking shipments of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe State Department said Tzav 9's supporters have, for months, impeded humanitarian aid deliveries, at times blocking roadways, attacking delivery trucks, and throwing out the aid supplies they have been carrying. The State Department noted one particular incident on May 13 in which Tzav 9 supporters allegedly looted and set fire to two trucks near Hebron, en route to the Gaza Strip with humanitarian aid.\n\nThe State Department said the U.S. government will sanction Tzav 9 under authorities laid out in a February executive order targeting groups and individuals deemed to pose a threat to peace, security, and stability of the West Bank and Gaza, Israel, and the broader Middle East region. The executive order authorizes the federal government to freeze U.S. assets belonging to sanctioned groups and individuals and blocks people in the United States from contributing funds and resources to these designated groups and individuals. The executive order also closes legal pathways for members of these sanctioned groups to enter the United States.\n\nIn addition to announcing the sanctions designation, the State Department said it also expects the government of Israel to take action to prevent groups from disrupting the flow of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.\n\nTzav 9, which roughly translates in English to \"Order 9,\" is one of the main activist organizations involved in these efforts to disrupt the humanitarian deliveries to the Gaza Strip. A translation of the group's X social media profile biography states, \"No aid gets through -- until the last of the kidnapped returns!\"\n\nWhile claims abound that Hamas has diverted humanitarian deliveries for its own benefit, it's difficult to independently assess how prevalent this pattern of behavior may be, amid the ongoing fighting in the Gaza Strip.\n\nWhile the Biden administration has generally continued to back the Israeli government in its military campaign in the Gaza Strip, the administration has increasingly pressed for cease-fire efforts and urged the Israeli government to also enable a greater flow of humanitarian assistance to the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn April, the U.S. Treasury Department announced additional sanctions targeting the Mount Hebron Fund and Shlom Asiraich; a pair of fundraising organizations the department said were linked to Mr. Levi and Mr. Chasdai.",

        "title": "French workers and youth call to free imprisoned Ukrainian socialist Bogdan Syrotiuk",
        "body": "facebook icon\n\nAs they joined in the International Committee of the Fourth International's (ICFI) global picketing of Ukrainian embassies demanding the liberation of Bogdan Syrotiuk, members of the Parti de l'égalité socialiste (PES) interviewed workers and youth in Paris. They called to free Bogdan Syrotiuk, a socialist fighting to unify Russian and Ukrainian workers against the war but who has been jailed on fraudulent charges of being a Russian agent and is now threatened with life in prison.\n\nNadia and Fatima called for the liberation of Syrotiuk, supporting his call to unify Russian and Ukrainian workers against the war. Nadia said, \"He should not be in prison in any way. He has the right to speak out, he has freedom of expression, as we do also. He has said nothing bad, why has he been taken away and locked up this way?\"\n\nThey rejected the political lie that opposition to the war in Ukraine is supposedly the same as support for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Fatima explained: \"We're against the war, too. My father fought in the war, he served in the armed forces for 17 years including during the war against the Germans [World War II] and then the Algerian war. He had three ribs taken out of him by the German air force.\"\n\nAsked about the sympathies of leaders of the Ukrainian regime for Ukrainian Nazi-collaborationists like Stepan Bandera, Fatima said: \"We are not satisfied with this. People are dying, youth are dying, it is horrible. There is a truly infernal danger.\"\n\nNadia connected the struggle to free Syrotiuk to the struggle against war with Russia: \"We do not want this war, and we cannot allow people [like Syrotiuk] to be condemned this way. He has done nothing wrong. We should be looking at the good he has been doing, not passing judgment on his political activity without any solid basis.\"\n\nFatima added, \"We want everyone to live together, as brothers and sisters, to live in honesty with each other. Why make children to then send them to be killed? It's sick. We worked to raise children, and as soon as they have grown up just a little bit, they are sent off to be massacred. Why should they die? What good does it do? It is unfair, it's horrible, and if we do not stop it, afterwards everyone will disappear.\"\n\nPES members also spoke to Zach, a high school student, who called to free Bogdan Syrotiuk: \"He must be freed. He is someone who is for peace and for building the unity of the workers. This is something that is very important for fighting the regime of Putin.\"\n\nZach compared Syrotiuk to Alfred Dreyfus, a French Jewish officer who was falsely convicted of treason by an antisemitic cabal in the army. Asked what he thought of the argument that opposing the US-NATO war with Russia in Ukraine is the same as support for Putin, he said: \"That is a lie, as far as I am concerned, like the Dreyfus Affair. No one should be imprisoned on the basis of lies and unverified allegations.\"\n\nPES members also interviewed Clémence, a reader of the WSWS. She said, \"We must demand the release of Bogdan Syrotiuk! His arrest by the Ukrainian authorities is an attack on freedom of expression, like that of Julian Assange. It is part of a campaign of repression against not only left-wing but also anti-war and anti-capitalist views of all kinds that is becoming increasingly widespread across Europe and the world.\"\n\nClémence refuted the political lie that NATO's war against Russia is a war for democracy: \"Ukraine is not a democracy! Elections have been suspended, and the country is under martial law. Parties claiming to be left-wing have been banned by government order, on the pretext that they are pro-Russian. On the other hand, parties like Svoboda, which directly descend from the [Ukrainian] collaboration with the Nazi occupying forces, have almost total freedom.\"\n\nShe added, \"For their part, the capitalist great powers in Europe and the United States are promoting the far right to maintain their economic and geopolitical interests by criminalizing the left and openly supporting and arming the genocide in Gaza.\"\n\nOn the ICFI's call to build an international movement in the working class to free Bogdan Syrotiuk and stop the war, Clémence said she supports \"demonstrating for Bogdan Syrotiuk and all those oppressed by authoritarian regimes. Let's create an anti-war movement in the working class, the only class with the power to stop the production and transport of military material for the belligerent governments and to bring down the capitalist regimes of Putin and Zelenski and their allies.\"\n\nRead moreICFI mounts international pickets demanding the Ukrainian government release Bogdan Syrotiuk13 June 2024An Open Letter to the Ukrainian government: Release Bogdan Syrotiuk!11 June 2024Contact usRelated TopicsFind out more about these topics:Free Bogdan Syrotiuk!US-NATO Conflict with Russia over UkraineFranceEurope",

        "body": "WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration Friday took the unusual step of blacklisting a group of Israelis implicated in the looting and destroying of life-saving humanitarian aid destined for Palestinians trapped in the Gaza Strip after eight months of brutal war.\n\nIt is only the second time in recent years the U.S. has punished Israeli groups for their violent and sometimes deadly actions against Palestinians.\n\nLast year, the State Department announced it was banning U.S. entry to dozens of Jewish Israeli settlers who attacked Palestinian villagers in the West Bank, destroyed their properties and attempted to seize their land.\n\nSeveral hundred Palestinians in the West Bank have been killed in recent months in these attacks as well as in operations by the Israeli military.\n\nThe latest U.S. measure targets a group known as Tzav 9, Hebrew for \"Order 9,\" a reference to call-up orders for Israeli reservists. U.S. officials say the group has ties to extremist Jewish settlers in West Bank settlements.\n\n\"For months, individuals from Tzav 9 have repeatedly sought to thwart the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza, including by blockading roads, sometimes violently, along their route from Jordan to Gaza, including in the West Bank,\" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement. \"They also have damaged aid trucks and dumped life-saving humanitarian aid onto the road.\"\n\nThey have also burned aid trucks, he said. \"We will not tolerate acts of sabotage and violence targeting this essential humanitarian assistance,\" Miller said.\n\nWith negotiations for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war still unsuccessful, the inability of international organizations to get food, water and medicine into Gaza has deepened the suffering there, with more than one million Palestinians facing starvation. Aid agencies report that children are dying from malnutrition, and hundreds of people are dying from lack of medical care. Most hospitals have been rendered inoperable due to Israeli bombardment.\n\nIsrael last month closed the Rafah crossing on Gaza's border with Egypt, a principal entry point for aid. The U.S. military built a pier into Gaza's coast for aid deliveries, but it has been plagued by high seas and other problems that have limited its ability to deliver aid.\n\nTzav 9 claims it is stopping \"gifts\" from reaching Hamas, the militant group in Gaza whose attack on kibbutzim and a musical festival in southern Israel on Oct. 7 left nearly 1,200 Israelis and others dead and triggered the current war.\n\nAt times Israeli extremists have filmed themselves in the act of blocking trucks, destroying cargo and dumping aid in the road.\n\nMore than 36,000 Palestinians - many civilians - have been killed by Israel's air and land operations in Gaza as of May 31.\n\nIt is not clear what impact the new sanctions will have on the group. The measures bar members of the sanctioned group from financial transactions with American persons or entities, and may impede their travel to the U.S. Any assets they have in the U.S. would be frozen.\n\nThe State Department also called out the Israeli government, noting it was Israel's \"responsibility to ensure the safety and security of humanitarian convoys transiting Israel and the West Bank en route to Gaza.\n\nFriday's action comes in part in response to an urgent plea from Jordan, which has been supplying most of the targeted aid trucks. Jordan has been able to dispatch up to 40 trucks a day to Gaza. It is a tiny fraction of what aid workers say is the bare necessity.\n\n___\n\n©2024 Los Angeles Times. Visit at latimes.com.

        "body": "The deal, which parties referred to as a government of national unity, will bring the ANC together in government with the Democratic Alliance (DA), a white-led party that had for years been the main opposition and a fierce foe for the ANC.\n\nAt least two other smaller parties will also be part of the agreement that put South Africa into uncharted waters with the first national coalition government in its democratic history.\n\n\"The government of national unity is on track,\" ANC secretary-general Fikile Mbalula said. \"For the interest of the country, we said let's work together. We have no fear of that.\"\n\nThe agreement was necessary after the ANC lost its 30-year majority in a humbling national election for it last month. It was a turning point for Africa's most industrialised economy. The ANC is the party of Nelson Mandela and had governed with a comfortable majority ever since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994.\n\nThat three-decade dominance ended in the May 29 election, when the ANC's share of the vote dropped to 40% amid discontent from South Africans over high levels of poverty, inequality and unemployment.\n\nAll the parties have said they would put their differences aside to work in the best interests of the country.\n\nHowever, analysts warned there might be complications ahead given the starkly different ideologies of the ANC, a former liberation movement, and the centrist, business-friendly DA -- the two biggest parties and the key players. The DA won 21% of the vote in the national election, the second largest share.\n\nFor one, the DA disagreed with the ANC government's move to accuse Israel of genocide in Gaza in a highly sensitive case at the United Nations' top court.\n\nDA leader John Steenhuisen was the first to confirm that an agreement was dramatically signed on Friday when Parliament was in a break.\n\n\"From today, the DA will co-govern the Republic of South Africa in a spirit of unity and collaboration,\" Mr Steenhuisen said as he broke away from the proceedings to make a speech that was carried live on television. He called it an \"historic step forward.\"\n\nMr Steenhuisen said the DA would back the 71-year-old Mr Ramaphosa for president and because the two parties have a clear joint majority of seats in Parliament, Mr Ramaphosa's re-election now appeared to be assured.\n\nThe Parliament session first went through the hours-long swearing-in of hundreds of new MPs and electing a speaker and a deputy speaker, before the house set to vote on the president, well into the night. Two candidates were nominated -- Mr Ramaphosa and Julius Malema, the leader of the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters party which had refused to join the unity government.\n\nA majority of the votes cast in a secret ballot in the 400-member lower house of Parliament, called the National Assembly, was required to elect a president.\n\nFormer President Jacob Zuma's MK Party was boycotting the session, which did not after the voting as only a third of the house is needed for a quorum.\n\nParliament convened in an unusual setting after a fire in 2022 gutted the National Assembly building in Cape Town and lawmakers came together at a conference centre near the city's waterfront.\n\nTwo other smaller parties said they would be part of the coalition agreement and Mr Mbalula said the ANC was open to talking with anyone else who wanted to join the unity government.\n\nThere are 18 political parties represented in Parliament and Mr Mbalula said the multi-party agreement would \"prioritise the country across the political and ideological divide\". Some parties refused to join.\n\nThe other two parties to join were the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Patriotic Alliance, which has drawn attention because of its strong anti-immigration stance and because its leader, Gayton McKenzie, served a prison sentence for bank robbery.\n\n\"The deal is we are putting South Africa first,\" Mr McKenzie said in an interview on state broadcaster SABC. \"We are going to work together. We have decided we are not going to let South Africa die in our hands, on our watch.\"\n\nThe ANC had faced a deadline to get a coalition agreement given parliament had to sit for the first time and vote for the president within 14 days of the election results being declared on June 2.\n\nThe ANC had been trying to strike a coalition agreement for two weeks and the final negotiations went through the night Thursday and into Friday, party officials said.\n\nSouth Africa had not faced this level of political uncertainty since the ANC swept to power in the first all-race election in 1994 that ended nearly a half-century of racial segregation.\n\nThe party had held a clear majority in parliament since then, meaning parliamentary votes for the president were formalities and every South African leader since had been from the ANC, starting with Mr Mandela.\n\nThis unity government also harked back to the way Mr Mandela, South Africa's first black president, invited political opponents to be part of a new unity government in 1994 in an act of reconciliation. The ANC's hand was forced this time.\n\n\"The ANC has been very magnanimous in that they have accepted defeat and have said, 'let's talk',\" PA leader Mr McKenzie said.",

This coalition, termed a \"government of national unity,\" marks the first national coalition government in South Africa's democratic history. The agreement was necessitated after the ANC lost its 30-year majority in a recent election, securing only 40% of the vote amid widespread discontent over poverty, inequality, and unemployment.\n\nKey figures include ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula, DA leader John Steenhuisen, and Patriotic Alliance leader Gayton McKenzie. The DA, which won 21% of the vote, has agreed to support Ramaphosa for president, ensuring his re-election due to their combined majority in Parliament. The coalition aims to prioritize national interests despite ideological differences, particularly between the ANC's liberation movement roots and the DA's centrist, business-friendly stance.\n\nThe coalition agreement was finalized just before the parliamentary deadline, following intense negotiations. Parliament convened in a temporary venue due to a fire in 2022 that damaged the National Assembly building. The session included the swearing-in of new MPs and the election of parliamentary leaders before voting on the president. Julius Malema of the Economic Freedom Fighters was the only other presidential candidate, as his party refused to join the unity government.\n\nThis coalition reflects a significant shift in South African politics, reminiscent of Nelson Mandela's inclusive government in 1994, but driven by the ANC's recent electoral defeat.",

        "title": "Ramaphosa set for re-election in South Africa after coalition agreement",
        "body": "The deal, which parties referred to as a government of national unity, will bring the ANC together in government with the Democratic Alliance (DA), a white-led party that had for years been the main opposition and a fierce foe for the ANC.\n\nAt least two other smaller parties will also be part of the agreement that put South Africa into uncharted waters with the first national coalition government in its democratic history.\n\n\"The government of national unity is on track,\" ANC secretary-general Fikile Mbalula said. \"For the interest of the country, we said let's work together. We have no fear of that.\"\n\nThe agreement was necessary after the ANC lost its 30-year majority in a humbling national election for it last month. It was a turning point for Africa's most industrialised economy. The ANC is the party of Nelson Mandela and had governed with a comfortable majority ever since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994.\n\nThat three-decade dominance ended in the May 29 election, when the ANC's share of the vote dropped to 40% amid discontent from South Africans over high levels of poverty, inequality and unemployment.\n\nAll the parties have said they would put their differences aside to work in the best interests of the country.\n\nHowever, analysts warned there might be complications ahead given the starkly different ideologies of the ANC, a former liberation movement, and the centrist, business-friendly DA -- the two biggest parties and the key players. The DA won 21% of the vote in the national election, the second largest share.\n\nFor one, the DA disagreed with the ANC government's move to accuse Israel of genocide in Gaza in a highly sensitive case at the United Nations' top court.\n\nDA leader John Steenhuisen was the first to confirm that an agreement was dramatically signed on Friday when Parliament was in a break.\n\n\"From today, the DA will co-govern the Republic of South Africa in a spirit of unity and collaboration,\" Mr Steenhuisen said as he broke away from the proceedings to make a speech that was carried live on television. He called it an \"historic step forward.\"\n\nMr Steenhuisen said the DA would back the 71-year-old Mr Ramaphosa for president and because the two parties have a clear joint majority of seats in Parliament, Mr Ramaphosa's re-election now appeared to be assured.\n\nThe Parliament session first went through the hours-long swearing-in of hundreds of new MPs and electing a speaker and a deputy speaker, before the house set to vote on the president, well into the night. Two candidates were nominated -- Mr Ramaphosa and Julius Malema, the leader of the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters party which had refused to join the unity government.\n\nA majority of the votes cast in a secret ballot in the 400-member lower house of Parliament, called the National Assembly, was required to elect a president.\n\nFormer President Jacob Zuma's MK Party was boycotting the session, which did not after the voting as only a third of the house is needed for a quorum.\n\nParliament convened in an unusual setting after a fire in 2022 gutted the National Assembly building in Cape Town and lawmakers came together at a conference centre near the city's waterfront.\n\nTwo other smaller parties said they would be part of the coalition agreement and Mr Mbalula said the ANC was open to talking with anyone else who wanted to join the unity government.\n\nThere are 18 political parties represented in Parliament and Mr Mbalula said the multi-party agreement would \"prioritise the country across the political and ideological divide\". Some parties refused to join.\n\nThe other two parties to join were the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Patriotic Alliance, which has drawn attention because of its strong anti-immigration stance and because its leader, Gayton McKenzie, served a prison sentence for bank robbery.\n\n\"The deal is we are putting South Africa first,\" Mr McKenzie said in an interview on state broadcaster SABC. \"We are going to work together. We have decided we are not going to let South Africa die in our hands, on our watch.\"\n\nThe ANC had faced a deadline to get a coalition agreement given parliament had to sit for the first time and vote for the president within 14 days of the election results being declared on June 2.\n\nThe ANC had been trying to strike a coalition agreement for two weeks and the final negotiations went through the night Thursday and into Friday, party officials said.\n\nSouth Africa had not faced this level of political uncertainty since the ANC swept to power in the first all-race election in 1994 that ended nearly a half-century of racial segregation.\n\nThe party had held a clear majority in parliament since then, meaning parliamentary votes for the president were formalities and every South African leader since had been from the ANC, starting with Mr Mandela.\n\nThis unity government also harked back to the way Mr Mandela, South Africa's first black president, invited political opponents to be part of a new unity government in 1994 in an act of reconciliation. The ANC's hand was forced this time.\n\n\"The ANC has been very magnanimous in that they have accepted defeat and have said, 'let's talk',\" PA leader Mr McKenzie said.",

        "summary": "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is set for re-election following a historic coalition agreement between the African National Congress (ANC) and the Democratic Alliance (DA), along with two smaller parties, the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Patriotic Alliance. This coalition forms the first national unity government in South Africa's democratic history, necessitated by the ANC losing its 30-year majority in the recent election, where it garnered only 40% of the vote. The DA, which secured 21% of the vote, has agreed to support Ramaphosa for president. Despite ideological differences, the parties have committed to working together for the country's benefit. The coalition agreement was finalized just before the parliamentary session, which included the swearing-in of new MPs and the election of a speaker and deputy speaker. The session took place in a conference center due to a fire that damaged the National Assembly building in 2022. The ANC's coalition efforts were driven by a deadline to elect a president within 14 days of the election results. This political shift marks a significant moment of uncertainty and change in South Africa's political landscape since the end of apartheid in 1994.",

        "title": "The G7 Summit and the need for a fairer world",
        "body": "The current global system, established in the aftermath of World War II, struggles to effectively address the myriad challenges facing the world today. Initially shaped by the interests and aspirations of a select group of states, this system now exacerbates conflicts and impedes global peace, stability, and prosperity.Thank you for reading this post, don't forget to subscribe!\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, the international community has confronted a new era marked by escalating crises. Collaboration at regional and global levels has become imperative, necessitating broader engagement from diverse global actors in resolving pressing issues. Yet, recent conflicts such as the Ukraine-Russia war and Israel's actions in Palestine underscore the international community's inability to effectively manage regional challenges or demonstrate decisive problem-solving.\n\nThe influence of traditional international organizations is waning, largely due to their failure to adapt to the multipolar dynamics of the modern world emerging since the turn of the century. It is increasingly evident that a global system cannot be dictated by a handful of superpowers pursuing their political and ideological agendas. Such an approach marginalizes the interests and rights of other nations and peoples, undermining the system's legitimacy and effectiveness.\n\nAcknowledging this reality is crucial for international organizations and dominant states alike. They must adjust their strategies to reflect the evolving global landscape. The current international framework, conceived post-World War II, teeters on the brink of collapse, highlighting the urgent need for a system that resonates with contemporary challenges and aspirations.\n\nAmid these developments, the upcoming G7 summit assumes particular significance. Assembled around common values of freedom, democracy, and human rights, the G7 faces scrutiny over its role in addressing recent global crises. Although lacking the authority for binding decisions, the G7's discussions on maintaining a rules-based international system are timely, given the increasing violations of established norms by certain states.\n\nThe theme of this year's summit underscores the critical need to uphold international rules and norms in the face of blatant violations. Instances such as Israel's actions in Gaza, deemed by many as flagrant war crimes, highlight the system's failures to enforce its own standards effectively. Despite calls for ceasefire and global condemnation, international responses have been inadequate, reflecting a broader systemic dysfunction.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's advocacy for a fairer, more inclusive global order resonates amid these challenges. Türkiye's active role in mediating conflicts and promoting stability underscores its commitment to global peace, amidst escalating threats from migration, climate change, and terrorism.\n\nIn conclusion, restructuring the international system is imperative to prioritize the rights of the oppressed over the interests of the powerful. The dysfunction observed in recent crises underscores the urgent need for reform and renewed commitment to a system that promotes equitable global governance and peace.",

        "title": "U.S. punishes Israeli extremists accused of blocking, ransacking humanitarian aid for Gaza",
        "body": "The Biden administration Friday took the unusual step of blacklisting a group of Israelis implicated in the looting and destroying of life-saving humanitarian aid destined for Palestinians trapped in the Gaza Strip after eight months of brutal war.\n\nIt is only the second time in recent years the U.S. has punished Israeli groups for their violent and sometimes deadly actions against Palestinians.\n\nLast year, the State Department announced it was banning U.S. entry to dozens of Jewish Israeli settlers who attacked Palestinian villagers in the West Bank, destroyed their properties and attempted to seize their land.\n\nSeveral hundred Palestinians in the West Bank have been killed in recent months in these attacks as well as in operations by the Israeli military.\n\nThe latest U.S. measure targets a group known as Tzav 9, Hebrew for \"Order 9,\" a reference to call-up orders for Israeli reservists. U.S. officials say the group has ties to extremist Jewish settlers in West Bank settlements.\n\n\"For months, individuals from Tzav 9 have repeatedly sought to thwart the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza, including by blockading roads, sometimes violently, along their route from Jordan to Gaza, including in the West Bank,\" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement. \"They also have damaged aid trucks and dumped life-saving humanitarian aid onto the road.\"\n\nRead more: Biden vs. Trump: Where they stand on Israel, Palestinians, Middle East\n\nThey have also burned aid trucks, he said. \"We will not tolerate acts of sabotage and violence targeting this essential humanitarian assistance,\" Miller said.\n\nWith negotiations for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war still unsuccessful, the inability of international organizations to get food, water and medicine into Gaza has deepened the suffering there, with more than one million Palestinians facing starvation. Aid agencies report that children are dying from malnutrition, and hundreds of people are dying from lack of medical care. Most hospitals have been rendered inoperable due to Israeli bombardment.\n\nIsrael last month closed the Rafah crossing on Gaza's border with Egypt, a principal entry point for aid. The U.S. military built a pier into Gaza's coast for aid deliveries, but it has been plagued by high seas and other problems that have limited its ability to deliver aid.\n\nTzav 9 claims it is stopping \"gifts\" from reaching Hamas, the militant group in Gaza whose attack on kibbutzim and a musical festival in southern Israel on Oct. 7 left nearly 1,200 Israelis and others dead and triggered the current war.\n\nAt times Israeli extremists have filmed themselves in the act of blocking trucks, destroying cargo and dumping aid in the road.\n\nMore than 36,000 Palestinians - many civilians - have been killed by Israel's air and land operations in Gaza as of May 31.\n\nIt is not clear what impact the new sanctions will have on the group. The measures bar members of the sanctioned group from financial transactions with American persons or entities, and may impede their travel to the U.S. Any assets they have in the U.S. would be frozen.\n\nThe State Department also called out the Israeli government, noting it was Israel's \"responsibility to ensure the safety and security of humanitarian convoys transiting Israel and the West Bank en route to Gaza.\n\nFriday's action comes in part in response to an urgent plea from Jordan, which has been supplying most of the targeted aid trucks. Jordan has been able to dispatch up to 40 trucks a day to Gaza. It is a tiny fraction of what aid workers say is the bare necessity.",

        "body": "The deal, which parties referred to as a government of national unity, will bring the ANC together in government with the Democratic Alliance (DA), a white-led party that had for years been the main opposition and a fierce foe for the ANC.\n\nAt least two other smaller parties will also be part of the agreement that put South Africa into uncharted waters with the first national coalition government in its democratic history.\n\n\"The government of national unity is on track,\" ANC secretary-general Fikile Mbalula said. \"For the interest of the country, we said let's work together. We have no fear of that.\"\n\nThe agreement was necessary after the ANC lost its 30-year majority in a humbling national election for it last month. It was a turning point for Africa's most industrialised economy. The ANC is the party of Nelson Mandela and had governed with a comfortable majority ever since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994.\n\nThat three-decade dominance ended in the May 29 election, when the ANC's share of the vote dropped to 40% amid discontent from South Africans over high levels of poverty, inequality and unemployment.\n\nAll the parties have said they would put their differences aside to work in the best interests of the country.\n\nHowever, analysts warned there might be complications ahead given the starkly different ideologies of the ANC, a former liberation movement, and the centrist, business-friendly DA -- the two biggest parties and the key players. The DA won 21% of the vote in the national election, the second largest share.\n\nFor one, the DA disagreed with the ANC government's move to accuse Israel of genocide in Gaza in a highly sensitive case at the United Nations' top court.\n\nDA leader John Steenhuisen was the first to confirm that an agreement was dramatically signed on Friday when Parliament was in a break.\n\n\"From today, the DA will co-govern the Republic of South Africa in a spirit of unity and collaboration,\" Mr Steenhuisen said as he broke away from the proceedings to make a speech that was carried live on television. He called it an \"historic step forward.\"\n\nMr Steenhuisen said the DA would back the 71-year-old Mr Ramaphosa for president and because the two parties have a clear joint majority of seats in Parliament, Mr Ramaphosa's re-election now appeared to be assured.\n\nThe Parliament session first went through the hours-long swearing-in of hundreds of new MPs and electing a speaker and a deputy speaker, before the house set to vote on the president, well into the night. Two candidates were nominated -- Mr Ramaphosa and Julius Malema, the leader of the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters party which had refused to join the unity government.\n\nA majority of the votes cast in a secret ballot in the 400-member lower house of Parliament, called the National Assembly, was required to elect a president.\n\nFormer President Jacob Zuma's MK Party was boycotting the session, which did not after the voting as only a third of the house is needed for a quorum.\n\nParliament convened in an unusual setting after a fire in 2022 gutted the National Assembly building in Cape Town and lawmakers came together at a conference centre near the city's waterfront.\n\nTwo other smaller parties said they would be part of the coalition agreement and Mr Mbalula said the ANC was open to talking with anyone else who wanted to join the unity government.\n\nThere are 18 political parties represented in Parliament and Mr Mbalula said the multi-party agreement would \"prioritise the country across the political and ideological divide\". Some parties refused to join.\n\nThe other two parties to join were the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Patriotic Alliance, which has drawn attention because of its strong anti-immigration stance and because its leader, Gayton McKenzie, served a prison sentence for bank robbery.\n\n\"The deal is we are putting South Africa first,\" Mr McKenzie said in an interview on state broadcaster SABC. \"We are going to work together. We have decided we are not going to let South Africa die in our hands, on our watch.\"\n\nThe ANC had faced a deadline to get a coalition agreement given parliament had to sit for the first time and vote for the president within 14 days of the election results being declared on June 2.\n\nThe ANC had been trying to strike a coalition agreement for two weeks and the final negotiations went through the night Thursday and into Friday, party officials said.\n\nSouth Africa had not faced this level of political uncertainty since the ANC swept to power in the first all-race election in 1994 that ended nearly a half-century of racial segregation.\n\nThe party had held a clear majority in parliament since then, meaning parliamentary votes for the president were formalities and every South African leader since had been from the ANC, starting with Mr Mandela.\n\nThis unity government also harked back to the way Mr Mandela, South Africa's first black president, invited political opponents to be part of a new unity government in 1994 in an act of reconciliation. The ANC's hand was forced this time.\n\n\"The ANC has been very magnanimous in that they have accepted defeat and have said, 'let's talk',\" PA leader Mr McKenzie said.",

        "summary": "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is set for re-election following a historic coalition agreement between the African National Congress (ANC) and the Democratic Alliance (DA), marking the first national coalition government in the country's democratic history. The ANC, which lost its 30-year majority in a recent election, will govern alongside the DA and at least two smaller parties, the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Patriotic Alliance. The coalition aims to address national issues despite differing ideologies, with the DA securing 21% of the vote and agreeing to support Ramaphosa. The agreement was finalized just before a parliamentary deadline, ensuring Ramaphosa's re-election. The coalition reflects a significant political shift, reminiscent of Nelson Mandela's unity government in 1994.",
