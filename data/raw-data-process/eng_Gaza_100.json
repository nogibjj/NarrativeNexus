        "body": "Israel's military said Thursday it targeted what it called a \"Hamas compound\" inside of a school in the Gaza Strip, an attack Hamas-affiliated media reported killed at least 32 people and wounded dozens.\n\nInformation about the strike in the Nuseirat area remained contradictory Thursday morning, and The Associated Press could not immediately independently confirm details about the strike.\n\nHamas' al-Aqsa television broadcaster reported at least 39 dead, without offering a source for the figures. The Palestinian news agency WAFA said at least 32 people were killed and dozens of others wounded.\n\nThe Israeli military said its fighter jets struck the school run by the United Nations agency providing aid to the Palestinians, known by the acronym UNRWA.\n\nThe Israeli military claimed, without immediately offering evidence, that Hamas and the Islamic Jihad used the school as cover for their operations.\n\n\"Before the strike, a number of steps were taken to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians during the strike, including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information,\" the Israeli military claimed.\n\nThe Nuseirat refugee camp is in the middle of the Gaza Strip. It is a built-up Palestinian refugee camp in central Gaza dating back to the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.\n\nThe Israeli military published a graphic of the school, which clearly had \"UN\" on its roof. The graphic described the strikes targeting two areas of the building on its upper floors.\n\nThe war began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack inside Israel that killed at least 1,200 people with 250 others taken hostage. The Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, with hundreds of others killed in operations in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.",

        "title": "UN Chief Wants Tax on Profits of Fossil Fuel Companies",
        "body": "GENEVA -- U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres called June 5 for a \"windfall\" tax on profits of fossil fuel companies to help pay for the fight against global warming, calling them the \"godfathers of climate chaos.\"\n\nGuterres spoke in a bid to revive the world's focus on climate change at a time when elections, inflation and conflict in places like Ukraine, Gaza and Sudan have seized the spotlight.\n\nIn a speech timed for World Environment Day, the U.N. chief drew on new data and projections to make a case against Big Oil. The European Union's Copernicus service, a global reference for tracking world temperatures, said last month was the hottest May ever, marking the 12th straight monthly record high.\n\nRELATED: Big Oil Investigation Sent to Justice Department by Dems\n\nThe service cited an average surface air temperature of 15.9 degrees Celsius (60.6 degrees Fahrenheit) last month -- 1.52 degrees Celsius higher than the estimated May average before industrial times.\n\nThe burning of fossil fuels -- oil, gas and coal -- is the main contributor to global warming caused by human activity.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization said the global mean near-surface temperature for each year from 2024 to 2028 is expected to range between 1.1 and 1.9 degrees Celsius hotter than at the start of the industrial era. The landmark Paris climate accord of 2015 set a target of keeping the rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\n\"Beyond the predictions and statistics is the stark reality that we risk trillions of dollars in economic losses, millions of lives upended and destruction of fragile and precious ecosystems and the biodiversity that exists there,\" Ko Barrett, the WMO's deputy secretary-general, told a news conference in Geneva.\n\n\"What is clear is that the Paris Agreement target of 1.5 degrees Celsius is hanging on a thread. It's not yet dead, but it's hanging by a thread,\" she added.\n\n\"This forecast is affirmation that the world has entered a climate where years that are as hot as 2023 should no longer be a surprise,\" Noah Diffenbaugh, a professor at Stanford's Doerr School of Sustainability, said by email.\n\nA woman is silhouetted against the setting sun in August 2023 in Kansas City, Mo. Last month was the hottest May in history, the 12th straight month to set a record high. (Charlie Riedel/Associated Press)\n\nA study released June 4 by 57 scientists said as the world keeps burning fossil fuels, Earth is likely to reach the 1.5-degrees-Celsius limit in 4½ years.\n\nU.N. experts and academics have repeatedly highlighted how rising temperatures can upend climate patterns and cause drought, flooding and forest fires. That can lead to climate migration, higher costs for farm products or insurance, and greater public health risks linked to high heat or water scarcity.\n\nAntónio Guterres, U.N. secretary-general\n\n\"While some individuals may escape direct consequences, we will all be affected,\" said Waleed Abdalati, who heads an environmental sciences institute at the University of Colorado Boulder.\n\nRELATED: Ten States Ask Court to Invalidate SEC's New Climate Rule\n\nGuterres appealed to media and technology companies to stop taking advertising from the fossil fuel industry's biggest players, as has been done in some places with Big Tobacco.\n\nHe also repeated concerns about subsidies paid in many countries for fossil fuels that help keep prices low for consumers.\n\n\"Climate change is the mother of all stealth taxes paid by everyday people and vulnerable countries and communities,\" he said. \"Meanwhile, the godfathers of climate chaos -- the fossil fuel industry -- rake in record profits and feast off trillions in taxpayer-funded subsidies.\"\n\nGuterres said global emissions of carbon dioxide must fall 9% each year to 2030 for the 1.5-degree Celsius target under the Paris Agreement to be kept alive.\n\n\"We need an exit ramp off the highway to climate hell,\" Guterres said. \"The truth is, we have control of the wheel.\"\n\nHe called on the Group of 20 countries -- which are holding a summit in Brazil next month and are responsible for about 80% of all carbon dioxide emissions -- to lead. The richest 1% of people on Earth emit as much as two-thirds of all humanity, he said.\n\n\"We cannot accept a future where the rich are protected in air-conditioned bubbles, while the rest of humanity is lashed by lethal weather in unlivable lands,\" Guterres said.\n\nHe appealed to \"global finance,\" alluding to banks and international financial institutions, to help contribute, saying \"innovative sources of funds\" are needed.\n\n\"It's time to put an effective price on carbon and tax the windfall profits of fossil fuel companies,\" Guterres said.\n\nBut all countries must join the fight, he said, including the developing world, such as by ending deforestation and meeting targets to double energy efficiency and triple the use of renewable energy by 2030.\n\nFor the first time, a promise of $100 billion a year in climate finance agreed in 2009 was fulfilled, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Still, experts say that's well below what's needed to fill the finance gap, with estimates of the annual cost of the global energy transition in the trillions.\n\nSome experts said Guterres' alarmist rhetoric, including a reference to \"playing Russian roulette\" with the planet, could turn off some people.\n\n\"A phrase like this that conjures images of holding a gun to our head risks shifting the conversation away from the science and solutions and more toward the emotion,\" Abdalati said, adding that \"phrases like this serve as fodder for critics, who will claim this is hyperbole.\"\n\nU.N. officials acknowledge that the secretary-general has little power beyond the \"bully pulpit\" -- his perch at the head of the world body -- to encourage change.",

        "body": "An ex-Meta engineer sued his former company for wrongful termination, alleging that he was fired after investigating pro-Palestinian content as part of his job.\n\nFerras Hamad worked as a software engineer for Meta and was tasked with overseeing Instagram content filters related to the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, according to the complaint. He filed the lawsuit against Instagram's parent company, Meta, on Tuesday in California state court in Santa Clara.\n\nHis role focused on investigating \"severe issues\" also known as SEVs with the online platform. The lawsuit alleges that Meta terminated him due to his Palestinian background and for raising questions about how the company handled a Palestinian photojournalist's Instagram account.\n\n\"Specifically, Plaintiff was scrutinized, interrogated, and terminated because he was of Palestinian national origin and/or Muslim investigating a SEV related to one of the most famous Palestinian photojournalists during the conflict in Gaza,\" the complaint states.\n\n\"Plaintiff did not receive similar scrutiny, interrogation, or adverse employment actions when he responded to SEVs related to Ukraine or other world events,\" the complaint added.\n\nMeta said in a statement that Hamad \"was dismissed for violating Meta's data access policies, which we make clear to employees will result in immediate termination.\"\n\nThe photojournalist's account had been incorrectly labeled as \"pornographic,\" according to the complaint. The complaint alleges that Hamad's manager initially told him he did not violate any company policy regarding the issue and that he handled it properly.\n\nHe was allegedly fired on Feb. 2 from Meta in connection \"to a violation of its User Data Access Policy,\" according to the complaint. The complaint alleged that Meta said that Hamad may have personally known the photojournalist, who had more than 17 million followers.\n\n\"Plaintiff was terminated despite confirmation from Plaintiff's manager that he had acted correctly and from META's own security operations personnel unequivocally stating the Plaintiff did not violate META's User Data Access Policy,\" the complaint read.\n\nThe complaint states that it is \"highly improbable\" that Hamad would know the photojournalist, noting that Hamad has never been to Gaza and was born in the United States.\n\n\"In reality, Plaintiff is simply the latest victim of META's callus, chronic, and consistent anti-Palestinian bias,\" the complaint states.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

        "body": "Skin diseases have been spreading in Gaza's so-called \"safe zone\" in Al Mawasi, near the southern area of Khan Younis, as people driven there by Israel's military operations struggle with a lack of water and proper housing.\n\nDr Hossam Nasser used to work at the Indonesia Hospital in the northern Gaza Strip but fled south after Israel launched its war against Hamas in October. Since then, he has managed to establish a field clinic for people who are unable to reach a hospital because of injury or the continuing fighting.\n\n\"The reason behind the spread of skin diseases is the shortage of water, which has led to people being unable to clean themselves properly,\" Dr Nasser told The National.\n\n\"We are in the summer season and people usually take baths twice a day in hot weather, but now they can't even bathe once a week.\"\n\nThe shelters used by the more than 500,000 people encamped in the area are mostly made of nylon or metal sheets and are unsuitable for long-term habitation, he said.\n\n\"The hot weather increases the potential for spreading diseases and these materials make the tents even hotter.\"\n\nThe water available to the displaced people in Al Mawasi is not clean and unsuitable for use, while overcrowding in the tented areas has also exacerbated the spread of skin diseases, he said.\n\nDr Nasser said most of the cases he sees are skin-related, especially among babies because their skin is sensitive and needs special care. Some people come in with sores and blisters all over their bodies.\n\n\"The spread of flies and insects has caused these sores and boils to appear because of bites. These insects gather around the garbage and there is, of course, no water to maintain hygiene. These sores start at a single point on the body and without proper care, they spread all over.\n\n\"The difficulty in obtaining medicine to treat these cases makes the situation worse,\" he said, referring to shortages of essential items in the Palestinian territory after Israel placed it under siege at the start of the war.\n\n\"Basic creams and antibiotics are unavailable, as are fever-reducing medications.\"\n\nAl Mawasi resident Eed, 40, who is living in a tent after fleeing Rafah, said the means to avoid infection were practically non-existent.\n\n\"The waste everywhere is a breeding ground for diseases and there is no medical care or medicine available. My tent, which I made from nylon, is so hot that we can't bear to stay inside it. At the same time, it is not a good option to spend time outside it,\" he said.\n\nAnother resident, Umm Omar, said her daughter Marwa, 7, was suffering from scabies spreading all over her body because of the lack of clean water, which her other children had to fetch.\n\n\"My children walk a long distance to reach it and bring it back here,\" said Umm Omar, who fled to Al Mawasi from Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza.\n\n\"This disease is contagious and I cannot isolate my daughter from her siblings because we all live together in one tent. She is always crying because of the pain.\"\n\nShe said she was able to get the medicine the doctor prescribed for Marwa, at a cost of 30 Israeli shekels ($8), but would not be able to do so again.\n\n\"I bought it this time, but I won't be able to afford it next time because of the lack of money, and my husband doesn't work,\" she said.",

        "title": "A shock poll in South Dakota and a NY streets fight",
        "body": "Welcome to a Wednesday edition of Progress Report.\n\nThere's all kinds of news to discuss tonight, but first, a bit of personal news and a programming note:\n\nMy sister-in-law passed away on Monday after a valiant two-month battle against an inoperable brain tumor. It's been a surreal and unbearably difficult year, but as I wrote on Instagram, her indefatigable optimism and courage are now a source of inspiration and resilience. I'll be spending time with family this weekend, so there will be no newsletter on Saturday or Sunday. We'll be back to a regular schedule by mid-week next week. Thank you for understanding.\n\nOK, now let's get to the news.\n\nNote: To make this work as accessible as possible, I've lowered the price for a paid subscription back down to Substack's $5 minimum. If you can't afford that right now, please email me and I'll put you on the list for free, no questions asked. Every paid subscription makes it sustainable for me to do this.\n\nHere's the catch: the next step is a vote by the city council on whether or not to put the initiative on the ballot. Had the activists collected at least 80k signatures, they could have skipped that step and gone right to the ballot, but they only had the resources to hit the 24,600 signature number that puts it before the council. They'll face an uphill battle to win over the City Council, which already rejected the opportunity to put it directly on the ballot in April.\n\nIf it does get on the ballot, it'll be an interesting dynamic: San Diego Gas and Energy, the utility company, will undoubtedly spend a massive amount of money on a vote no campaign, and unions with workers at the company will mobilize, as well. The same dynamic played out in Maine last year, where a similar statewide amendment wound up getting crushed. But with SDG&E price gouging its way to record profits, anything is possible.\n\n✝️ 🤑 Voucher virus: Conservatives in Oregon are working to qualify a ballot initiative that would create a voucher program that siphons money off to private and religious schools. The publicity around the measure, though, is far more advanced than the campaign itself.\n\nSchool privatization advocates have around 30,000 petition signatures banked and a bit less than a month to gather at least another 130,000 valid signatures, so it's going to take a one of the great grassroots campaigns in modern memory to get this thing on the November ballot.\n\nIf only that were the case in the rest of the country. There are now 11 states with expansive school privatization voucher scam policies in place, and even though many of them haven't yet taken on their final universal form, they are already sending billions of public dollars to private religious schools.\n\n🏜️ 🙄 High stakes: A decade and a half since the state's \"Show Me Your Papers Act\" inspired generational blowback and turned Arizona into a swing state, Republicans in the legislature are betting that a rising tide of anti-immigrant sentiment will help them consolidate power once more.\n\nOn Tuesday, the House rerouted the controversial Secure the Border Act, vetoed earlier this year by Gov. Katie Hobbs, to the November ballot, where voters will weigh in directly on whether they want a return to draconian immigration policies. The bill mimics the patently unconstitutional law passed by Texas that bars illegal entry into the state by people from outside the country. Immigration law is in fact a federal responsibility, but with this Supreme Court, all bets are off.\n\nArizona's ballot, by the way, is going to be packed to the brim with tight elections this year. It's a presidential battleground, has an open US Senate seat up for grabs, there are several close Congressional races, the legislature could very easily flip, and there's already an abortion rights amendment set to go before voters.\n\n🔉 😲 Wow: A new poll out of South Dakota finds that support for an abortion rights ballot amendment is up by nearly 20 points, with even a plurality of Republicans in favor.\n\nOverall, 53% of voters in South Dakota say they will vote for the amendment, while 35% plan to vote it down. Eleven percent of South Dakotans said they were uncertain about lifting the total prohibition on reproductive rights in the state. The amendment has surged in support since last fall, when it had just a 46-44% lead.\n\nThe amendment is relatively modest, as far as these things go. Abortion would be protected in the first trimester, while the health of the mother must be factored into any regulations written for the second trimester.\n\n🥤 🇬🇧 Milkshake, duck: A 25-year-old woman named Victoria Thomas Bowen fired a milkshake directly into the puckered face of right-wing British leader Nigel Farage on Tuesday, producing one of the great action shots in the history of political photography while humiliating the country's most smug racist.\n\nBowen, who is a Jeremy Corbyn supporter and OnlyFans model, also delivered one of the great quotes in recent memory when asked why she flung the McDonald's shake at the Reform UK leader. After initially explaining that she \"just felt like it,\" Bowen added cut down the nationalist leader in just a few sentences.\n\n\"He doesn't stand for me, he doesn't represent anything I believe in, or any of the people around here,\" she told the BBC. \"He doesn't represent us, he's not from here.\"\n\nBowen now faces assault charges, but I'm confident that she won't have trouble raising money for her legal defense. What a hero.\n\n🛂 👎 Profiles in courage: President Biden on Tuesday signed an executive order intended to drastically reduce the number of people who cross into the United States through the southern border.\n\nThe order gives Biden the power to \"shut down\" the border -- or in practice, make it virtually impossible for a migrant to claim asylum and deport them ASAP -- any time the number of crossings exceed 2,500 on a given day. The border would be permitted to \"open\" again when the number of crossings falls below 1,500 per day.\n\nFor context, there have been an average of 3,700 crossings per day during Biden's presidency, while there hasn't been a day with fewer than 1,500 crossings since July 2020. Unless this order suddenly dissuades well over half of migrants who would otherwise have crossed the border, it's going to essentially be permanent.\n\nIf the policy sounds familiar, it's because it is a significant chunk of the ill-fated bill put together Congress earlier this year and essentially the same exact policy as a 2018 executive order issued by Donald Trump and blocked by a federal judge. Shortly taking office, Biden reversed a number of other immigration policies that Trump put into place in 2018, calling them a \"moral and national shame.\"\n\nThe change of heart is very obviously a reaction to negative poll numbers, which have been driven by a real crisis further inflamed by conservative fear-mongering. It should not have come to this; for several years now, Democratic mayors and governors have been calling on the federal government to expedite work permits and other aid for migrants, with little response from the White House. Now, five months until the election, Biden is hoping a crackdown will win over the plurality of voters who for three months running have named immigration as the issue that most concerns them.\n\nWith many immigrant and Hispanic organizations incensed at the White House, it's a gambit that will only succeed if it manages to change the narrative or at least quiet the relentless drumbeat of criticism from Republicans and conservative media. Early returns aren't great: the only story on FoxNews.com regarding federal immigration policy last night was about a congressman allegedly named \"Chip Roy\" barking at AG Merrick Garland about a DOJ lawsuit over Texas's refusal to stop drowning migrants.\n\n🙏 😀 Vindication: Journalists and many liberals spent Tuesday poking fun at an undecided voter who told pollster Frank Luntz and the New York Times that Trump's inability to pull off a bribe to a porn star made him seriously question his fitness to be president.\n\nSuch glib mockery is a function of a misplaced sense of superiority that afflicts so many members of the DC political press corps, but that's nothing new. Proximity to power does that to people. The reality is that this is how most Americans assess politics, especially when it comes to candidates with whom they are encouraged to have a parasocial relationship.\n\nMost Democratic leaders don't really seem to understand how people outside the bubble engage with the reality show of government, which is why I wrote this treatise on Sunday about why Democrats should be rushing to mock Donald Trump for being a pitiful little sex pest who was too big of a loser to not get caught paying off a porn star.\n\nAs a reminder, I'm available for hire as a media and political strategist.\n\n😡 🗡️ Disappointment: Like so many progressives here in New York and beyond, I was once fooled into believing that former Rep. Mondaire Jones had any firm principles beyond the belief that Mondaire Jones should be in Congress.\n\nOn Monday, Jones officially endorsed George Latimer in his bitter primary campaign against Rep. Jamaal Bowman, completing one of the most nakedly cynical political transformations in recent memory.\n\nLet's rewind: When he first ran for Congress in 2020, Jones, who previously served in the Obama DOJ, positioned himself in a crowded primary as a bold, action-oriented progressive who rejected corporate money and championed government reforms. What's more, his personal story was just as compelling: Jones was raised by a single mother in Section 8 housing, graduated from Stanford and Harvard Law, and aimed to be the first openly gay Black man in Congress.\n\nThat he wound up sharing that historic distinction with Rep. Richie Torres would prove to be grimly ironic.\n\nShare\n\nI got to know and enthusiastically supported the 2020 version of Mondaire Jones, which included raising money for his primary campaign via this very newsletter. Both he and Bowman were part of a fresh new generation of progressive New Yorkers in Congress, having vanquished old incumbents who sat far other right.\n\nJones's first term rewarded that faith, as he delivered on his promise to push Democrats past their mealy-mouthed stupor, in part through his work on promoting Supreme Court expansion. Then New York got a crappy new Congressional map and DCCC chair Sean Patrick Maloney decided to jump the line and run in Jones's district in Rockland County. Progressive outrage ensued, but Maloney didn't budge, and the resources at his disposal convinced Jones to run elsewhere.\n\nSeveral sources told me back in 2022 that he considered running in a primary against Bowman in NY-16 that summer, but polling nixed that idea, so he instead bolted to a district in Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, nowhere near his home.\n\n(Side note: In his endorsement of Latimer, Jones had the audacity to call himself \"one of the most popular Democrats in the Hudson Valley,\" which is a bizarre self-assessment for a guy who deemed himself not popular enough to win a primary in any part of the Hudson Valley just two years ago.)\n\nJones wasn't going to win the race in NYC, either, and he siphoned off just enough votes from popular progressive Assemblywoman Yuh-Line Niou to hand the district to uber-wealthy Levi's heir Dan Goldman. Niou, who we endorsed after she helped take down disgraced former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, really took it on the chin in that race, as she was also the target of nasty,! misleading ads paid for Goldman's real estate and AIPAC supporters.\n\nThis time around, Jones is running against GOP Rep. Mike Lawler in a district much closer to the one he originally represented, and has turned himself into an ardent backer of Israel's war in Gaza, which he cited as the main reason he's backing Latimer against Bowman. Latimer is the beneficiary of millions of dollars in AIPAC spending, while Jones has taken more than $300k from the right-wing, pro-Netanyahu lobby group over the past number of years.\n\nCrucially, however, AIPAC has already endorsed Lawler, who this spring teamed with none other than Richie Torres on a gross bill threatening sanctions against colleges with anti-genocide protests.\n\nExactly what Jones is getting out of this endorsement is a bit murky, but he's angered all his old allies and put his entire political career on the line, so congrats to him on that. He also earned his place as a prime example of why I have largely stopped raising money for candidates running for federal office and now focus instead on movements and organizations designed to build long-term infrastructure and power for people, not politicians.\n\n🚘 ⛔ Speaking of NY disappointments: New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced today that she was indefinitely delaying the long-awaited and desperately-needed congestion pricing scheme that would have been the biggest change to public transportation since the subway replaced the elevated rail line.\n\nThe plan would have charged drivers a $15 toll to drive south of 60th Street in Manhattan, with exemptions for cabbies, delivery trucks, and other critical services. It was expected to dramatically reduce traffic and air pollution in the city while bringing in $1 billion a year for long overdue investments in public transportation. As is her wont, Hochul offered up a half-baked, cynical explanation for her decision, which amounted to a slap in the face to an array of advocacy groups in pursuit of support from more conservative suburban voters who have never backed her.\n\nIn this instance, Hochul said that congestion pricing would have taken a toll on the city's economic recovery from the pandemic and hurt working class New Yorkers. Reality does not support either of these excuses: New York's economy has fully recovered, as Hochul declared in this March release, while just 4% of outer-borough New Yorkers drive into Manhattan with any regularity.\n\nIf there's any economic motivation for Hochul here, you can find it in her lamenting of the occupancy rates of corporate office buildings, which are owned by her biggest donors.\n\nProgress Report has raised over $7 million dollars for progressive candidates and causes, breaks national stories about corrupt politicians, and delivers incisive analysis, and goes deep into the grassroots.\n\nNone of the money we've raised for candidates and causes goes to producing this newsletter or all of the related projects we put out.

        "body": "Israel has confirmed its air force struck a school in the Nuseirat refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip, claiming that the refugee facility, where dozens of people were reportedly killed, actually housed a Hamas militant compound.\n\nAt least 30 people were killed and dozens injured in the strike on the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) facility on Thursday morning, medical sources in the Hamas-run Palestinian enclave told Xinhua, while Reuters sources confirmed 27 fatalities. Gaza media office condemned the attack as a \"terrible massacre,\" calling it a \"clear evidence of the crime of genocide committed against civilians.\"\n\nThe Israeli military has acknowledged the air raid, but insisted it targeted a Hamas compound and successfully eliminated \"several terrorists\" who allegedly plotted attacks against Israeli troops.\n\n\"A short while ago, IAF fighter jets, directed by IDF intelligence and the ISA, conducted a precise strike on a Hamas compound embedded inside an UNRWA school in the area of Nuseirat,\" the Israeli military confirmed in a statement early Thursday morning.\n\n\"The terrorists directed terror from the area of the school while exploiting it and using it as a shelter,\" the IDF added, insisting that it conducted thorough aerial surveillance and gathered additional intelligence before the strike to \"reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians.\"\n\nLast month, at least 45 Palestinians were killed when Israeli jets bombed the southern Gazan city of Rafah, causing a large fire at a camp housing displaced people. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the strike \"a tragic mistake,\" and promised that it would be investigated.\n\nThe Gaza-based Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a series of raids into Israel on October 7 last year, dubbed 'Al-Aqsa Flood.' An estimated 1,200 Israelis were killed in the attacks, while another 250 were taken captive. Israel responded with a military offensive that has claimed the lives of over 36,000 Palestinians and devastated much of the enclave's infrastructure.\n\nThe United Nations' International Court of Justice (ICJ) recently ordered the Jewish state to \"immediately halt its military offensive\" as part of a 'genocide' complaint. Meanwhile the International Criminal Court (ICC) is seeking arrest warrants for Israeli and Hamas leaders, including Netanyahu and his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, over alleged war crimes against Palestinian civilians in Gaza.",

        "body": "Israel targeted a Gaza school on Thursday that it said contained an Hamas compound, killing fighters involved in the Oct. 7 attack that sparked the eight-month war, but Gaza media said the strike killed at least 27 people seeking shelter.\n\nIsmail Al-Thawabta, the director of the Hamas-run government media office, rejected Israel's claims that the UN school in Nuseirat, in central Gaza, had hidden a Hamas command post.\n\n\"The occupation uses lying to the public opinion through false fabricated stories to justify the brutal crime it conducted against dozens of displaced people,\" Thawabta told Reuters.\n\nIsrael's military said that before the strike by Israeli fighter jets, the military took steps to reduce the risk of harm to civilians.\n\nIsrael has said there will be no halt to fighting during ceasefire talks.\n\nIn an apparent blow to a truce proposal touted last week by US President Joe Biden, the leader of Hamas on Wednesday said the group would demand a permanent end to the war in Gaza and Israeli withdrawal as part of a ceasefire plan.\n\nThe remarks by Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh appeared to deliver the Palestinian fighter group's reply to the proposal that Biden unveiled last week. Washington had said it was waiting to hear an answer from Hamas to what Biden described as an Israeli initiative.\n\n\"The movement and factions of the resistance will deal seriously and positively with any agreement that is based on a comprehensive ending of the aggression and the complete withdrawal and prisoners swap,\" Haniyeh said.\n\nAsked whether Haniyeh's remarks amounted to the group's reply to Biden, a senior Hamas official replied to a text message from Reuters with a \"thumbs up\" emoji.\n\nWashington is still pressing hard to reach an agreement. CIA director William Burns met senior officials from mediators Qatar and Egypt on Wednesday in Doha to discuss the ceasefire proposal.\n\nSince a brief week-long truce in November, all attempts to arrange a ceasefire have failed, with Hamas insisting on its demand for a permanent end to the conflict, while Israel says it is prepared to discuss only temporary pauses until the fighter group is defeated.\n\nBiden has repeatedly declared that ceasefires were close over the past several months, only for no truce to materialise.\n\nLast week's announcement came with far greater fanfare from the White House, and at a time when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under mounting domestic political pressure to chart a path to end the eight-month-old war and negotiate the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nHamas, which rules Gaza, precipitated the war by attacking Israeli territory on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Around half of the hostages were freed in the war's only truce so far, which lasted a week in November.\n\nIsrael's military assault on Gaza has killed more than 36,000 people, according to health officials in the territory, who say thousands more dead are feared buried under the rubble.\n\nISRAEL LUKEWARM\n\nAlthough Biden described the ceasefire proposal as an Israeli offer, Israel's government has been lukewarm in public. A top Netanyahu aide confirmed on Sunday Israel had made the proposal even though it was \"not a good deal\".\n\nFar-right members of Netanyahu's government have pledged to quit if he agrees to a peace deal that leaves Hamas in place, a move that could force a new election and end the political career of Israel's longest-serving leader.\n\nCentrist opponents who joined Netanyahu's war cabinet in a show of unity at the outset of the conflict have also threatened to quit, saying his government has no plan.\n\nMeanwhile, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said there would be no let-up in Israel's offensive while negotiations over the ceasefire proposal were under way.\n\n\"Any negotiations with Hamas would be conducted only under fire,\" Gallant said in remarks carried by Israeli media after he flew aboard a warplane to inspect the Gaza front.\n\nIsrael announced a new operation against Hamas in central Gaza on Wednesday, where Palestinian medics said airstrikes had killed dozens of people.\n\nThe armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they had fought gun battles with Israeli forces on Wednesday in areas throughout the enclave and fired anti-tank rockets and shells.\n\nTwo children were among the dead laid out on Wednesday in the city's Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, one of the last hospitals functioning in Gaza. Mourners said the children had been killed along with their mother, who had been unable to leave when others in the neighbourhood did.",

        "title": "Trump Attacks Chuck Schumer On Israel Stance: 'He's Become Like A Palestinian'",
        "body": "Former U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's (D-N.Y.) stance on Israel's handling of the Gaza conflict, comparing him to a Palestinian.\n\nWhat Happened: Trump made these remarks during an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity. He suggested that Israel's support in Congress has dwindled, citing Schumer and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D-N.Y.) as examples, reported The Hill.\n\nTrump said, \"Even Schumer, he's become like a Palestinian. Chuck Schumer. Jewish. Always strong for Israel. He's become like a Palestinian.\"\n\nIn a speech delivered in March, Schumer criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's management of the war with Hamas and advocated for new Israeli elections. His comments drew criticism, especially from Republicans, who deemed it inappropriate for Schumer to demand leadership changes in another democratic nation.\n\nDespite the backlash, Schumer has since facilitated the approval of legislation granting billions in funding to Israel amid its ongoing conflict with Hamas.\n\nTrump also voiced his opinion that Israel \"has to finish the job\" in its battle with Hamas, advocating for a swift and decisive end to the conflict.\n\nSee Also: Kim Jong Un's Minister Says North Korea Won't Be Sending Manure-Filled Balloons Anymore But Warns Resumption If South Korea Allows Anti-Pyongyang Leaflets\n\nWhy It Matters: Trump's criticism of Schumer's stance on Israel is not surprising, given his past support for the country. In a private New York gathering in May, Trump pledged to expel student protesters from the U.S. and expressed strong support for Israel.\n\nTrump has also previously criticized President Joe Biden for his perceived soft stance on antisemitism, despite his own controversial remarks on the subject.\n\nEarlier in March, Trump sparked controversy by suggesting that Jewish individuals voting for Democrats, including Schumer, were anti-Israel and hated their religion.\n\nPhoto Courtesy: Shutterstock.com\n\nRead Next: Latest Poll Of Independents And Republicans Could Spell Trouble For Donald Trump Following His Historic Conviction\n\nThis story was generated using Benzinga Neuro and edited by Shivdeep Dhaliwal\n\nMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs",

        "title": "Famine and the rising death toll in Gaza",
        "body": "Two Palestinian children died last week of starvation, dehydration and lack of medicine amid desperate conditions in the southern areas of the besieged Gaza Strip.\n\nThe Ministry of Health announced the death of Abdulqader Sirhi, 13, and seven-month-old Fayiz Abu Ataya, from malnutrition and lack of food and medicine at Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir Al-Balah. The ministry said that the number of famine-related deaths has risen to 37, with only those who reached the hospitals able to be counted. It added that many died in their homes and their deaths have not been registered, while others are fighting for their lives.\n\nOver 3,500 children, under the age of five, are facing an imminent risk of death due to shortages of food, nutritional supplements and vaccinations.\n\nFayiz Abu Ataya's father said: \"My child was born at the beginning of the current sweeping pogrom, in our shelter school, and died in it. He needed a special kind of formula and food missing in Gaza.\" The infant's short life is a chronicle of the deprivation overwhelming aid-starved Gaza.\n\nIn a statement, 70 international rights organizations - including the Geneva-based Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, Geneva International Centre for Justice, and Brussels Court - called on all relevant authorities and international institutions to officially declare a famine in the Gaza Strip. The statement stressed that food insecurity is increasing across the tiny enclave because of Israel's use of starvation as a weapon of war against the Palestinian people.\n\nThe joint statement also warned:\n\nWith the crossings closed and humanitarian aid being prevented from entering by Israel, the threat of famine and acute malnutrition has resurfaced and swiftly spread.\n\n\"This affects the 2.3 million residents of the Gaza Strip, half of whom are children, and particularly the people in the northern Gaza Valley, where supplies have run out.\"\n\nBefore Israel unleashed its current carnage, the poverty and unemployment rates in Gaza had reached heights of 64 per cent and 45 per cent respectively, according to data from the World Bank and the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS). Some 63 per cent of the people of the Strip were food insecure, while 80 per cent of Palestinians in the besieged enclave depended on international aid. Now, living under the genocidal war, things are aggravated. All families in the narrow enclave depend on foreign humanitarian aid, so their basic survival needs are affected by its cessation.\n\nUm Firas Ghanem, a Palestinian mother who was displaced from Gaza City and forced to move to Deir Al-Balah, has three children, the eldest just six years old. \"I fear for my kids, and I know, if we survive, the malnutrition and dehydration will impact their brain and growth,\" she said. \"There is no milk or eggs or meat or fruits, and if they are found, it's very few, and extremely expensive that I can't afford to buy it.\" Um Firas's family, like most of the displaced families, relies entirely on charities who provide them a meal every day. She is worried that if the Rafah Crossing remains closed, they will reach the point where no flour or canned food is available and children and patients will die in large numbers.\n\nThe Rafah Crossing has been closed since Israeli occupation forces took control of the vital area on 7 May, raising the Israeli flag to highlight its control. Now, thousands of trucks of food, water and medical supplies are stranded on the Egyptian side of the crossing awaiting Israel's approval to enter the besieged Strip to help alleviate the crises facing Palestinian civilians.\n\nThis is not the first time Israel has weaponized water as a weapon of war. For almost two decades the occupation state has besieged Gaza, limiting the entry of food and medical supplies in an effort to pressure the Palestinian resistance to make concessions. Prior to the current bombing campaign only 500 trucks of goods were allowed into Gaza a day, insufficient for the enclave's 2.3 million population. Since the end of October 2023, when Israel allowed aid to re-enter the Strip, after closing all the crossings for three weeks, only between 100-150 trucks have been allowed to enter Gaza each day, when deliveries have been approved\n\nThe humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza is only a fraction of what is needed to answer the enormous needs of an exhausted people. Since Israel stormed Rafah a month ago, no humanitarian aid has been allowed through the crossing and no injured Palestinians have been able to leave the Strip to access lifesaving medical care abroad. Now, even the few remaining devastated hospitals risk being out of service as fuel supplies dwindle.\n\nIn her partially damaged house in Gaza City, Amani Junaid, a mother of five, describes their life as a living hell. \"Our lives have completely stopped: no school, no hospital, no markets, no homes, no entertainment areas for kids, scarce clean water and food,\" she tells MEMO. \"Before March, we ate animal fodder. Now we have only flour, but we can't find anything to dip it in. We skip meals.\"\n\n\"My children keep asking me for chocolates, snacks, lollipops and I am in agony not being able to meet their needs,\" she adds. Amani has already lost her father during Israel's war, he died as a result of his inability to obtain the medication needed to stabilize his health.\n\nIn addition to Israel's control of the supply of humanitarian aid, it has also targeted food production factories, warehouses, markets, shops, stores, and bakeries, ensuring it controls access to all life saving supplies.\n\nIn spite of this, a famine has not been declared in Gaza. The delay in changing the conditions for the Palestinians of the Strip is another blow to a people who have struggled for decades under siege and occupation and a nod for Israel to continue its annihilation of the indigenous population of Palestine.",

The protest began at 3 p.m. after multiple organizations, including Labor for Palestine Los Angeles and UCLA Rank and File for a Democratic Union - a caucus within the union - posted on Instagram calling for people to rally in support of the strike.\n\nProtesters marched through South Campus to the UCPD station on Westwood Plaza and then the Luskin turnaround chanting phrases such as, \"Out of the classrooms, into the streets,\" \"Drop the charges now\" and \"What's disgusting? Union busting.\"\n\nOrganizers led the protest to demonstrate the existence of widespread support for the strike, said Jacqueline Perez, a psychology doctoral student and protest organizer. She added that the union plans to continue demonstrating until its demands are met.\n\n\"We seriously need to escalate our power and leverage that power against the University right now,\" Perez said. \"How we do that is by showing them the broad support that we have.\"\n\nAnny Viloria Winnett, the unit chair of UAW Local 4811 at UCLA, said in a speech that the rally aimed to draw attention to unfair labor practices that she alleged the university has engaged in on campus. She added that union members are continuing to protest in spite of recent arrests and threats of sanctions and conduct hearings against students.\n\nRandall Kuhn, a professor in the Fielding School of Public Health, said in a speech that he and other members of Faculty for Justice in Palestine at UCLA are proud of recent student protests. He added that he believes security on campus, including UCLA Health security workers, have suppressed pro-Palestine activism on campus by tearing down posters.\n\nThe UCLA Faculty Association joined UAW Local 4811 and the University Council-American Federation of Teachers in filing an unfair labor practice complaint against the UC on Monday for the University's treatment of members during the encampment and stifling of free speech. The UCLAFA is a nonunion entity, unlike UAW Local 4811 and UC-AFT.\n\nSiobhan Braybrook, a member of the faculty association, said one reason the association filed its charge was that UCLA's administration instructed faculty to avoid speaking about the strike. An email from university administrators including Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Darnell Hunt to the university community had told instructors not to speak to union members about the strike.\n\n\"Our jobs are to be here to teach, to research, to be inquisitive, to be curious, to ask questions and to build a better world,\" Braybrook said. \"We can't do our job with the university's gag order about what we can and cannot say.\"\n\n[Related: UCLA calls student hearings for arrested participants of pro-Palestine encampment]\n\nAs protesters marched toward the UCPD station, they blocked traffic along Charles E Young Drive.\n\nVincent Doehr, a member of Graduate Students for Justice in Palestine at UCLA, said in a speech that he believes recent decisions by UCPD - including the arrest of a student - have endangered student safety. He also alleged that a student who was attacked while wearing a keffiyeh had to wait two hours to file a police report about the incident.\n\n\"Our University is funding and profiting from the weapons used in Israel's genocide of Palestinians,\" said Doehr, a political science doctoral student. \"We have the right and the responsibility to resist and to demand divestment.\"\n\n[Related: UCLA Faculty Association files unfair labor practice charge against the UC]\n\nNon-University employees also rallied in solidarity with UAW.\n\nCliff Smith, the business manager of the United Union of Roofers, Waterproofers and Allied Workers Local 36, said in a written statement distributed at the rally that his organization stands in solidarity with UAW Local 4811's unfair labor practice strike and has called for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. Ethan Robins, a production staff worker, added that he attended the protest to show his support for the strike.\n\n\"Strikes are meant to disrupt, and protests are meant to disrupt,\" he said. \"If you're not disrupting, who are you showing you have a problem?\"\n\nUnion workers from the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees as well as United Teachers Los Angeles also said in speeches at the rally that their unions stand in solidarity with UAW Local 4811, and they called on the University to protect the right to protest.\n\nAround 50 people, including UCLA medical residents, demonstrated earlier in the day outside the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center around noon. Protesters chanted phrases such as, \"In solidarity, here we stand, with healthcare workers, hand in hand,\" and \"In our millions, in our billions, we are all Palestinians.\"\n\nThe rally came after recent attempts from the University to end the strike.\n\nThe UC announced Wednesday that it had filed a breach of contract lawsuit against UAW Local 4811, claiming the strike violates a no-strike clause in the 2022 collective bargaining agreement between the two parties. The move comes after the California Public Employment Relations Board - the state agency that administers collective bargaining agreements - denied two requests by the UC on May 23 and June 3 for injunctive relief to end the strike.\n\n\"The blatant breach of the parties' no-strike clauses by UAW will continue to cause irreversible harm to the University,\" said Melissa Matella, associate vice president for systemwide labor relations for the UC, in a statement Wednesday. \"It will disrupt the education of thousands of students in the form of canceled classes and delayed grades.\"\n\nThe latest lawsuit requests the state to issue a temporary restraining order on UAW Local 4811, which would effectively end the strike across all UC campuses. Union members at UCLA, UC Davis, UC San Diego, UC Santa Barbara, UC Irvine and UC Santa Cruz are currently all on strike.\n\n\"It's disheartening to see the union making it hard for students to attend the classes they've paid for, and right before finals when stress levels are at an all-time high,\" said Mary Osako, the vice chancellor of strategic communications in an emailed statement. \"UCLA is doing all we can to support our talented students so that they can get the education they deserve.\"\n\nIn Matella's statement, the UC further claimed that the strike is unlawful because UAW Local 4811 members are striking based upon political and social issues and not issues of labor. Rafael Jaime, president of UAW Local 4811 and an English doctoral student, said in a statement Monday that the union is striking because of the UC's violation of its employees' rights to free speech and peaceful protest.\n\nJuan Pablo Gatica, a member of UAW Local 4811, said the UC's choice to circumvent PERB's decision is unlawful.\n\n\"They can go on and on - filing injunctions, going to court, paying legal fees - all they want, because they're a multibillion dollar industry,\" he said. \"By going through those channels and completely circumventing it (PERB) - I think it's a gross injustice.\"",

Jerusalem, Jun 06, 2024 -The Israeli army said Thursday that it had carried out a deadly strike on a UN school in central Gaza that it said housed a \"Hamas compound\", with the Hamas media office saying at least 27 people were killed.\n\nIsraeli \"fighter jets... conducted a precise strike on a Hamas compound embedded inside an UNRWA school in the area of Nuseirat\", the army said in a statement, adding that several terrorists were \"eliminated\".\n\n\"Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists who belonged to the Nukhba Forces and took part in the murderous attack on communities in southern Israel on October 7th were operating in the compound,\" it said.\n\n\"The terrorists directed terror from the area of the school while exploiting it and using it as a shelter.\"\n\nThe Hamas media office said at least 27 people were killed and dozens injured in the strike and taken to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital.\n\nIt accused the Israeli army of carrying out a \"horrific massacre... that shames humanity\".\n\nThe hospital reported an electrical generator failure earlier in the night, which risked complicating the treatment of patients.\n\nPrior to the strike, the hospital had received at least 70 dead and more than 300 wounded since Tuesday, mostly women and children, following the Israeli strikes in central Gaza, according to Doctors Without Borders (MSF).",

        "body": "KHUSHWANT Singh would have been delighted. The latest Khushwant Singh Literary Festival (KSLF) revived his memory over two days at SOAS in London, the city he loved as much as his birthplace, Hadali (in Pakistan).\n\nThe sessions began and ended with two Pakistanis. The keynote speaker, on June 1, had taken Khushwant's ashes 10 years ago from Delhi for interment in Hadali. The closing session included a brilliant presentation by Prof Qasim Aziz, a professor of neuro-gastroenterology, speaking on the art of healing.\n\nThe London litfest followed the pattern of previous ones held each year at Kasauli (Khushwant's summer home), a military cantonment in Himachal Pradesh. Pakistanis are not allowed there. The local commandant felt it would be tantamount to 'allowing the enemy behind the lines'.\n\nLondon, by contrast, is apolitical. Indo-Pak-Bangladesh issues are miles away. The KSLF sessions could express opinions without invoking Chatham House rules. The only vapours of dissension came from a small group outside SOAS' Brunei Gallery, protesting against Israeli atrocities in Gaza.\n\nMany sweated the Raj out of their system.\n\nMany speakers sweated the Raj out of their system. One author -- the Bengali Subhadra Das -- dismantled the creaking structure of colonialism. She challenged assumptions that have moulded Western images of us, and our perception about ourselves.\n\nSome offered inspirational messages, aimed at self-improvement. Another linked distant Kolkata with the British Cotswolds in her talk on country walks through colonial Britain. Innovatively, she connected the residue of imperial wealth, citing buildings like the orient-inspired Sezincote in Gloucestershire.\n\nOnce, the British constructed Palladian public monuments to impress their colonial subjects with their imperial intent. Back home, they indulged themselves in private homes inspired by Indian themes and motifs, funded by the wealth they had accumulated abroad. This transfer of capital in the 19th century anticipated the mass movement of money in the 20th century, when oil-sodden Arabs, Russian oligarchs, Indian trillionaires and Pakistani politicians with unexplained cash denuded their own countries' wealth and transferred that money to buy expensive real estate in the UK Two half-Indian sisters -- Marina Wheeler and Shirin Wheeler -- talked about the biographies they had written of their Indo-British parents. The theme chosen for this year's KSLF, 'Healing the World', addressed the need to repair our fractured planet -- socially, and environmentally.\n\nNo session illustrated this better than the presentation by Robert Seatter, a BBC broadcaster/ poet. His talk, The Cello and the Nightingale, took the audience back to the early, now forgotten, days of radio. He described how, in the 1920s, a young British cellist sat in a garden and practised her cello. Suddenly a nightingale joined in, trilling. This duet continued for weeks. She wrote to the then head of the BBC and suggested that it might like recording this impromptu concert.\n\nAfter some initial reluctance, the BBC technicians were allowed to set up their equipment in the garden. The lady began playing her cello. For about half an hour, there was radio silence. Then, suddenly, the nightingale joined in. Nature and mankind were in spontaneous harmony.\n\nUplifting accounts like these made one forget that there are ugly human realities, like general elections. One of the speakers -- S.Y. Quraishi -- had served as the 17th Indian chief election commissioner. He spoke on India's Festival of Democracy; timely, as the general elections were underway in India. The audience was told that 2024 is election year, with 64 countries holding elections (except China, which held them last year).\n\nIn the UK, PM Rishi Sunak sprang a surprise by announcing a general election on July 4. The British have a choice between two S's -- Sunak and Starmer. Sunak came into 10 Downing Street through the back door. Starmer has been waiting on its front doorstep since 2020.\n\nIn the US, Donald Trump has no one but himself to blame for being ousted the last time, and for forfeiting the White House this year. Most leaders go from jail to the presidency. He might well be the first president to take the White House into the Jail House. Some wit said that American democracy offered choices. Its weakness was it offered only two choices. Voters in the US, and now the UK, are both confronted by this constricting disability.\n\nMercifully, within the hallowed halls of SOAS, discussions were non-abrasive. If only the accord that prevailed within could radiate throughout our war-riddled planet. The world's unborn owe much to the untiring commitment of KSLF's organisers -- the indefatigable Niloufer Bilimoria and Khushwant Singh's Rahul -- to save our finite earth from our infinite idiocies.",

While being escorted out, they pepper Harris one last time, asking how many babies she has killed and why she supports continued funding to Israel.\n\n\"Real babies have been beheaded, not the fake babies that Joe Biden said he saw,\" shouted another activist.\n\nOnce escorted out, a security guard from Jimmy Kimmel Live told this crew they were under arrest for interrupting a live television broadcast, which these activists scoffed at. He's later seen locking them in the studio.\n\nYou all know that the 15,000 figure is Hamas propaganda. The United Nations and Hamas have revised the actual death toll; the UN figures were reduced by 50 percent, not that anyone here noticed. Palestinians are dead because Hamas started a war with Israel. It's Hamas' fault, not Israel's, but I'm not going to stop the far left from eating its own here.\n\nAlso, here's your answer for the Biden strategists who thought cutting off arms shipments would impact these people.

        "title": "'Red Paint With Vile Messages': Albanese, Dutton Condemn Pro-Palestinian Protest Methods",
        "body": "Opposition Leader Peter Dutton has expressed concern in parliament about the offices of elected members of parliament being targeted with \"red paint\" and \"vile messages\" by pro-Palestinian protestors.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese has also highlighted of his concern about attacks at electorate offices, given the important work staff do.\n\nHe added that the targeting of people simply because they are Jewish is completely unacceptable.\n\n\"Tragically, it undermines the cause that protesters purport to advance. I have supported justice for Palestinians my whole life and still do. It is tragic that the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people are undermined by some people engaging in activity that completely alienates the Australian public due to the nature of that,\" he said.\n\nThe comments come after multiple parliamentarians were targeted with graffiti and vandalism in recent weeks amid the Israel-Hamas conflict. The United States consulate was also targeted in Melbourne on May 31.\n\n\"Teal\" Independent MP for Mackellar, Dr. Sophie Scamps, told Mr. Albanese in parliament she is concerned the Middle East conflict is \"impacting social cohesion here in Australia.\"\n\nShe said her office has received hundreds of emails about the events in the Middle East expressing concern about both Israel and Gaza suffering.\n\n\"The people of Mackellar were utterly appalled by the atrocities committed by Hamas and our hearts broke for the people of Israel. Now my community is deeply distressed also by the immense human suffering in Gaza.\"\n\nShe asked Mr. Albanese what the government's message is regarding the importance of bringing hostages home and ending the conflict.\n\n\"Hostages must be released. Civilians must be protected,\" he said.\n\n\"As President Biden has said, a deal would 'allow the United States and our partners to begin the work to rebuild homes, schools, and hospitals in Gaza to help repair communities destroyed in the chaos of war.'\"\n\nMr. Albanese noted Australia is not a participant in the conflict but has been a consistent voice for humanitarian concerns.\n\n\"The point that I've made as prime minister, from the very outset, is that every single innocent life matters -- every Israeli, every Palestinian. This government supports a two-state solution and an enduring peace. Two states: Israel and Palestine, living peacefully side by side with security and prosperity for their people.\"\n\nHe added within in Australia, everyone has a responsibility to keep the community safe, highlighting the importance of \"social cohesion.\"\n\n\"Our social cohesion is a national asset that all of us have built and all of us have a responsibility to uphold and defend,\" he said.\n\nThe prime minister explained that parliamentary staff do work to provide assistance to \"people dealing with Medicare, social security, migration, and other issues.\"\n\n\"They deserve respect, not abuse, not assault, not attacks on the office. Those things cost taxpayers money but cause, more importantly, considerable emotional distress and are anti-democratic by their very nature because they stop people participating in our democratic process and receiving services from members of the House of Representatives or of the Senate,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Opposition leader Peter Dutton said there is a bipartisan position on this issue in the chamber, adding that the Coalition condemns acts of violence, wherever they take place.\n\nMr. Dutton said just last week he was at a school in Sydney where armed guards have a permanent presence to protect young children going to school, not because they have done anything wrong, but \"because they are Jewish.\"\n\n\"We are seeing now the offices of elected members of parliament being targeted with red paint, with vile messages of hate and discrimination and antisemitism, and it should be condemned,\" he said.\n\n\"The world should stand together to condemn the actions of antisemitism.\"\n\nGreens Leader Adam Bandt said the House is united in condemning antisemitism and condemning Islamophobia.\n\nAmong the phrases seen at the offices were \"Glory to the Martyrs\" and \"Free Gaza\" in Melbourne, capital city of Victoria.\n\nElectorate offices of Attorney General Mark Dreyfus and Government Services Minister Bill Shorten were among those allegedly targeted.\n\nMr. Shorten said on May 31 people have a right to feel strongly about the \"distressing scenes in Gaza and Israel, but there's a line and you don't cross it.\"\n\n\"It's threatening coercive bullying, illegal conduct, and at a very pragmatic level, even if you just separate the fact that what they're doing is illegal. Who do they think they're persuading?\"",

        "title": "Trump, now a felon, presents huge political challenge",
        "body": "Say what you will about former US President Donald Trump, but give him his due.\n\nJust when you thought there were no norms of political etiquette left to destroy, Trump comes up with a sledgehammer, creating history by achieving the dubious distinction of becoming the first US president ever to be convicted as a felon.\n\nThis follows a whole slew of firsts: the first president in US history who refused to concede defeat; the first president to incite a mob to attack the US Capitol (the last time the Capitol was attacked was by the British in 1814); and the first president to defend insurrectionists. During his presidency, Trump lied with such abandon that the US media, usually deferential to the office, were forced to explicitly say so -- and keeping track of Trump's lies became a real journalistic exercise.\n\nThese dubious \"firsts\" are leavened generously with political misdemeanours of a bewildering variety and number. Just a random sampling: Trump forced his press aide to falsely claim that he had a larger crowd than Obama at the inauguration. He suggested bleach as a cure for Covid. To this day, he claims the 2020 presidential elections were rigged, despite the fact that all his campaign's lawsuits were thrown out of court by judges, including many appointed by him.\n\nThe extraordinary thing is not just how outrageous Trump's actions are. It is the fact that he keeps getting away with it. This has turned US politics on its head and has political analysts scratching their heads in despair.\n\nLet's take a quick trip down the memory lane to see what happened to another disgraced US president, and you will get an idea of how the guardrails have completely come off.\n\nOn August 7, 1974, Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, Senator Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania, and House Representative John Rhodes of Arizona -- the top Congressional Republican leaders -- gave erstwhile President Richard Nixon a warning: support within his party had plummeted, they told him, and Nixon was likely to be impeached. The next day, Nixon resigned. In a bit of gallows humour, erstwhile Republican Senator Bob Dole quipped that at least they had the burglar vote, referring to the break-in at Democratic headquarters in Washington, DC that snowballed into the scandal that felled Nixon.\n\nToday, it is impossible to imagine any Republican lawmaker standing up to Trump, and for good reason. Some have tried before and have had to kiss their political careers goodbye. Contrast the Republican leaders of the Nixon era with today's Republican lawmakers, who are falling all over themselves to ingratiate themselves to the former president.\n\nYet, the fact remains that Trump has been found guilty on 34 felony counts by a jury of his peers. It is noteworthy that Trump's family members were conspicuous by their absence -- only his son Eric showed up in court.\n\nWhatever happened to former First Lady Melania? Melania, it must be said, is an oddity. Whether it's Republican first ladies like Pat Nixon, Barbara or Laura Bush, or Democratic first ladies like Rosalynn Carter, Hillary Clinton or Michelle Obama -- US first ladies have a reputation for warmth and engagement. Much of it is stage-managed, to be sure, but all nonetheless command some degree of respect and affection. Melania is an exception. It isn't that she is widely loathed. The curious thing about her is that she is a bit of a cypher -- one doesn't quite know what to make of her.\n\nThat said, one can't be too harsh. It can't be much fun playing the loyal wife in a case where your husband is accused of giving hush money to cover up a liaison with a porn star. Marital loyalty has its limits.\n\nMeanwhile, the Republican Party is quite clearly stuck with Trump, felon or not. Trump's reaction has been his usual bluster: it's all rigged, everybody is out to get him. (Trump being Trump, he didn't miss this occasion to make a quick buck. His campaign reports that it raised over $58 million in 24 hours of the verdict. No surprise there: here is a guy who made money off his mugshot after he was booked in Georgia.)\n\nThanks to Trump, American politics is in uncharted territory. We have an unprecedented situation where the US Secret Service has to figure out how to provide the former president security if he does become a jailbird.\n\nMeanwhile, the upcoming presidential election in November is still up in the air. Trump is like the proverbial tail wagging the dog -- he holds a significant part of the Republican electorate in Svengali-like thrall. So now, it is he who decides what the Republican Party stands for, not vice versa.\n\nThe effect of Trump's conviction on his support is hard to gauge, given mixed response to recent polls. While he has lost some support, about half of the respondents say they are more likely to vote for him, Axios reports.\n\nIt is a strange world indeed, where a felony conviction fails to undo a presidential candidacy, but these are indeed the strange political times we live in. In the recent past, US presidential elections have had nail-biting finishes, with just some tens of thousands of votes in a handful of swing states determining the winner. Add to that the deepening polarisation where most voters are staunchly partisan, and you have a political tinderbox where every little thing matters.\n\nTrump's conviction may cast a shadow on his support, but then incumbent President Joe Biden isn't exciting the electorate all that much. Add to that Biden's stand on Israel's mass slaughter in Gaza, which has deeply antagonised two demographics Democrats desperately need to push Biden over the finish line: Black Americans and young people.\n\nFormer British Prime Minister Harold Wilson once observed, \"A week is a long time in politics.\" November is months away. Obviously, a lot can change as the world waits to see if Trump is capable of another first: can he be the first felon elected to be US president?\n\nWe won't know the answer to that before November 5. In the meantime, fasten your seatbelts, because this is going to be one crazy political rollercoaster ride.\n\nAshfaque Swapan is a writer and editor based in Atlanta, US.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\n\nWe welcome your contributions and analysis of global events, and responses to our articles.

At least 70 dead people and over 300 wounded, the majority of whom are women and children, have been brought to Al-Aqsa hospital in the last days following heavy Israeli strikes in the Middle Area of the Gaza strip.\n\n\"The odour of blood in the hospital's emergency room this morning was unbearable. There are people lying everywhere, on the floor, outside... bodies were being brought in plastic bags. The situation is overwhelming\", says Karin Huster, Medecins Sans Frontieres/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) medical team leader in Gaza.\n\nMedical teams in Al-Aqsa hospital - one of the only remaining functional health facility in the Middle Area - are currently trying to deal with a huge influx of patients, many of them arriving with severe burns, shrapnel wounds, fractures, and other traumatic injuries.\n\n\"With the insane escalation of violence in various locations of the Gaza strip over the last 48 hours and while the Rafah crossing point has remained closed for a month, the health system has been stretched to the point of collapse. The situation is apocalyptic.\" - Karin Huster.\n\nThe repeated mass casualties incidents are unacceptable and the horrific toll on civilians shows the total disregard for human lives in Gaza.

        "title": "Putin threatens missile deployment in response to Western aid to Ukraine",
        "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on Wednesday that he could deploy conventional missiles within striking distance of the United States and its European allies. This statement came amid concerns about Western countries providing Ukraine with long-range weapons that could reach deeper into Russia. In his first face-to-face meeting with senior editors of international news agencies since the onset of the Ukraine war, Putin warned the West against underestimating Russia's willingness to use nuclear weapons, emphasising the seriousness of the Kremlin's nuclear doctrine.\n\nAddressing NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg's calls to allow Ukraine to use Western weapons to strike Russian territory, Putin warned that such actions would escalate tensions and draw the West closer to war with Russia. He indicated that Russia's response would involve shooting down Western missiles, specifically mentioning U.S. ATACMS and British and French missile systems.\n\nPutin hinted at the possibility of deploying high-technology, long-range missiles close enough to strike states that permit Ukraine to target Russian territory. He stressed that such measures would be taken if these countries were perceived as being drawn into a war against Russia, warning of \"very serious problems\" without specifying potential missile deployment locations.\n\nLong discussion at Gazprom Tower\n\nSpeaking for over three hours at the Gazprom Tower ahead of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, Putin touched on various topics, including the war in Gaza and the upcoming U.S. elections. He accused the United States of prioritising its own interests over Ukraine's and criticized the U.S. judicial system's treatment of Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\nNuclear doctrine clarification\n\nPutin reiterated that Russia's nuclear doctrine permits the use of nuclear weapons if the nation's sovereignty and territorial integrity are threatened. He cautioned the West against taking this doctrine lightly, emphasising that it could consider using all available means if necessary.\n\nExistential battle with the West\n\nPutin framed the Ukraine conflict as an existential battle against a declining and decadent West, accusing Western powers of humiliating Russia post-1989 by encroaching on its sphere of influence, including Ukraine. He blamed the 2014 Maidan Revolution in Ukraine, which he described as a U.S.-backed coup, for the current conflict.\n\nWestern response\n\nWestern leaders and Ukraine have dismissed Russia's warnings of a broader war but have consistently cautioned against the possibility of Russia attacking a NATO member. Both Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden have stated that a direct conflict between Russia and NATO could lead to World War Three.\n\nPutin's final remarks\n\n\"You should not make Russia out to be the enemy. You're only hurting yourself with this, you know?\" Putin remarked, dismissing the notion that Russia intended to attack NATO as \"complete nonsense\" and \"total rubbish.\"",

        "body": "In the face of global condemnation of the war in Gaza, Golan has become a symbol of national resilience and pride for Israelis.\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams made a surprise appearance at a gala for an Israeli first responder group in Manhattan Tuesday night, where he declared \"Eden Golan Day\" in honor of the Israeli singer who won fifth place at Eurovision last month.\n\nGolan also took the stage at the United Hatzalah event to deliver the first US performance of her song \"Hurricane.\" The 20-year-old singer -- who drew pro-Palestinian protests at the European song contest as well as admiration from fans for her poise in the face of jeers -- was in the city to march in Sunday's pro-Israel parade on Fifth Avenue.\n\n\"We should all use our talents, and Eden has used hers in a real way,\" Adams said. \"And we know you should have won the total contest.\"\n\nAdams, who marched with Golan at the parade, added, \"People told us not to do the Israeli Day Parade. And I said, 'Not while I'm the mayor.' And you came, you marched by us, you showed us.\"\n\nGolan also received United Hatzalah's \"Hero Award,\" and performed two additional songs: \"Rise Up\" by Andra Day and Aerosmith's \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing.\" Her performance of both on the Israeli program \"Rising Star\" -- where in one performance she wore a yellow ribbon and was surrounded by empty chairs representing the hostages held captive in Gaza -- helped earn her the spot at Eurovision.\n\nEden Golan: a symbol of national resilience\n\nIn the face of global condemnation of the war in Gaza, Golan has become a symbol of national resilience and pride for Israelis. Hatzalah has taken on a measure of symbolism as well for its volunteers' first response work on and immediately after Oct. 7. In Israel's national Independence Day torch lighting ceremony, one of the group's volunteers was selected to light a torch.\n\n\"Wow you guys are so beautiful,\" Golan said from the stage. \"It's such an honor and a pleasure to be here. And to see all of you and to get to sing to you guys. ... Everything you do is just priceless. and so important to us. And it's my pleasure to share a bit of my love and my voice with you all tonight.\"\n\nSupport for Israel's war effort, and for its hostages who remain held by Hamas in Gaza, was everywhere at the gala, which was held at the elite Cipriani Wall Street. Women wore dresses in blue for Israel, yellow for the hostages, and orange for United Hatzalah. Guests also wore yellow ribbons or United Hatzalah pins, and some men who are involved with United Hatzalah wore orange suit jackets.\n\nThe event raised $20 million for United Hatzalah, and its fundraising portion was punctuated by dozens of guests shouting out their donations ranging from $1,000 to millions of dollars for ambulances, e-bikes, medical bags, and other equipment and services.\n\nA moment of silence was also dedicated to the lives lost on and since Oct. 7, and the event commemorated the life of Dolev Yehud -- an EMT with United Hatzalah who had been presumed taken hostage and whose remains were identified in Israel just days ago. His parents were reportedly scheduled to attend the gala, but returned to Israel upon receiving the news, one of the presenters said.\n\nAlso in attendance was Rami Davidian, who orchestrated the rescue of hundreds of people on Oct. 7. At one point during the evening, Davidian was reunited onstage with one of the women he rescued.\n\nOther guests included Jewish influencer and fashion blogger Lizzy Savetsky and husband, plastic surgeon Ira Savetsky; influencer Liv Schreiber; and owner of Morton Williams Supermarkets Avi Kaner.\n\nActor and comedian Michael Rapaport, who has become an outspoken advocate for Israel since Oct. 7, at times attracting controversy, emceed Tuesday's event. In an interview, he said he isn't concerned with the backlash he's received.\n\n\"My whole thing with social media has always been whether I'm talking about something mundane, like sports or pop culture, or something more serious, I just go,\" he said. \"I don't worry about who's going to hear me, who's not going to hear me. There's no way to predict it, or manufacture it. If there was, you know, I'd be a rich man.\"\n\nHe added, \"I just bleh. And that's why it comes off that way.\"",

        "title": "Dozens killed in Israeli strike on UN school, Gaza officials say",
        "body": "At least 27 people have been killed and dozens injured in an Israeli strike on a UN school housing displaced people in al-Nuseirat, in the central Gaza Strip, the Hamas-run Gaza government media office has said.\n\nIt accused the Israeli army of carrying out a \"horrific massacre ... that shames humanity\". There was no immediate confirmation by the health ministry, and the death toll could not immediately be verified.\n\nFootage on X posted by Palestinian journalists in the early hours of Thursday showed rows of bodies laid out at al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah, and wounded children being treated on the floor.\n\nThe Israeli military confirmed on X that it had targeted a UN school in al-Nuseirat, saying that it had been home to Hamas terrorists who had taken part in the 7 October attack on Israel. \"Terrorists\" who had been planning to carry out attacks in the immediate future had been \"eliminated\", it said, and that \"many steps were taken to reduce the chance of harm to those not involved\".\n\nThe attack on the school run by Unrwa, the UN refugee agency for Palestinians, follows the announcement on Wednesday by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) of a new operation against Hamas in central Gaza, with Palestinian medics saying airstrikes had killed dozens of people.\n\nThe charity Medicines Sans Frontiers (MSF) said that since Tuesday at least 70 dead and more than 300 wounded, mostly women and children, had been brought to al-Aqsa hospital after \"heavy Israeli strikes\" in central Gaza.\n\nKarin Huster, an MSF medical adviser in Gaza, described the situation as \"overwhelming\". \"There are people lying everywhere on the floor, outside ... bodies were being brought in plastic bags,\" she said on X.\n\nAn Israeli military statement said of the new operation: \"The forces of the 98th Division began a precise campaign in the areas of East Bureij and East Deir al-Balah, above and below ground at the same time.\"\n\nResidents said Israeli forces had sent tanks into Bureij and planes and tanks pounded the nearby settlements of al-Maghazi and al-Nuseirat as well as Deir al-Balah city.\n\nThe armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they had fought gun battles with Israeli forces in areas throughout the territory and fired anti-tank rockets and shells.\n\nAbu Mohammed Abu Saif said two of his children were among the dead brought to al-Aqsa hospital after the earlier Israeli strikes. \"This is not war, it is destruction that words are unable to express,\" he said, adding that his children had been killed along with their mother, who had been unable to leave when others in the neighbourhood did.\n\nAl-Aqsa hospital is one of the last hospitals functioning in Gaza. Earlier in the night it reported an electrical generator failure, which risked complicating the treatment of patients.\n\nIsrael also reiterated on Wednesday its refusal to halt the Gaza offensive for a resumption of hostage-release talks with Hamas, with defence minister Yoav Gallant quoted by Israeli media as saying, \"Any negotiations with Hamas would be conducted only under fire.\"\n\nHamas leader Ismail Haniyeh meanwhile said the group would demand a permanent end to the war in Gaza and Israeli withdrawal as part of a ceasefire plan.\n\nThe comments dealt an apparent blow to a much-touted truce proposal put forward last week by US president Joe Biden.\n\nIsrael's military assault on Gaza has killed more than 36,000 people, according to health officials in the territory, who say thousands more dead are feared buried under the rubble. The war was sparked by an unprecedented attack by Hamas in southern Israel in October last year, killing about 1,200 people.\n\nOn Wednesday two new food security reports reported that many Palestinians in Gaza had been killed by months of extreme hunger while permanent damage had been caused to children through malnutrition, even before famine is officially declared.\n\nThe US-based famine early warning system network (Fews Net) said it was \"possible, if not likely\" that famine began in northern Gaza in April. Two UN organisations said more than 1 million people were \"expected to face death and starvation\" by mid-July.\n\nIsrael has blocked the entry of much aid and fuel to Gaza, and cut off most of the water supply.\n\nIsrael's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has meanwhile threatened an \"extremely powerful\" response to attacks by Hezbollah from Lebanon, which have escalated in recent days and set off huge fires in northern Israel.",

        "title": "The hostages held by Hamas in Gaza are in our hearts every day",
        "body": "Behind every decision regarding the continuation of the war and the efforts to bring home the hostages is one unifying thread that must not be forgotten: There are families behind the numbers.\n\nThe Jerusalem Post hosted dozens of hostage families at our annual conference in New York City on Monday and at the previous evening's gala event.\n\nEmotions were running high on Sunday evening when Eyal Eshel, the father of Roni Eshel, took to the stage to speak about his daughter, an IDF lookout who was killed by Hamas terrorists. Heartache echoed in every word. Nevertheless, he spoke when so many of us would have collapsed with grief.\n\nThe gala concluded with an intense panel interview with family members of hostages: Devorah Idan, mother of Tsachi Idan; Moshe Emilio Lavi, brother-in-law of Omri Miran; and Ronen Neutra, father of Omer Neutra.They told the mortifying stories of the kidnapping of their loved ones.\n\nTsachi Idan was taken after being held in his home at gunpoint for hours. Omri Miran was taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz alongside his wife and daughters, who were later recovered; Omer Neutra was taken while defending Israel along the Gaza border.\n\nLosing sight of what is important\n\nSometimes, when we focus on policy issues such as whether to accept a hostage deal or fight until the end in the Gaza Strip, we can lose sight of what is most important and what is at the center of our reasoning for fighting for what we believe in: the people.\n\nBehind every policy, every decision, and every crudely yelled debate in the Knesset are hostages and their brothers, sisters, parents, and partners. There are people suffering the unimaginable, and we are losing sight of them. It is tearing our nation apart.\n\nWe do not have to agree with one another, but once we lose the respect that is so central to this fight for the existence of Israel and its citizens, we lose the central piece that must - and it truly must - be the motivation for how we operate in the Gaza Strip.\n\nDuring the gala, shortly after the panel, we brought hostage families onto the stage. We lit our phone flashlights in a message of hope for the hostages, and we - the entire audience - stood to sing Israel's national anthem, Hatikvah: \"The Hope.\"\n\nWe stood with our hostages and their families, we continue to do so, and we must never stop doing so.\n\nSpeaking at the conference the following day, Prof. Jonathan Dekel-Chen argued for a hostage deal, adding that he does not need to learn about Hamas. He understood exactly what he was saying: Israel \"must negotiate with Satan.\"\n\n\"No one here in this room or anywhere else needs to convince me what Hamas is,\" he said. \"I've lived on that border since 1981. I've been under Hamas mortars, rocket fire, and explosive balloons since 2008, so spare me the patriotism. We have held forth until October 7. There is no military solution. We have to negotiate with Satan to get our loved ones home.\"\n\nAn eerie silence filled the room. It is understandable that many do not agree that a deal is necessary: They believe the war must continue until the end.\n\nAs Herb Keinon wrote in Wednesday's Post, we often lose sight of the fact that the enemy in the Gaza war is not from within Israel; it is Hamas. Whether or not one thinks that a ceasefire is necessary or that Israel must fight until total victory, it's ultimately up to Hamas to accept or reject a deal.\n\nWe at The Jerusalem Post host a myriad of opinions. No plan is perfect, but behind every thought, theory, and decision regarding the continuation of the war against Hamas and the efforts to bring home the hostages is one unifying thread that must not be forgotten: There are families behind the numbers.\n\nThese heroes who took to the stage in New York are devoting every second of their now-suffered existence to their loved ones being held in God-only-knows-what conditions by terrorists.\n\nWe celebrate life, and we must continue to do so. Our motivation - our jus ad bellum - must revolve around a respect for human lives.\n\nTo the hostage families that attended our conference: Thank you for sharing your story. We may not always agree, but we will always respect you and your loved ones.\n\nWe see you, we hear you, and we are always thinking of you.",

        "body": "Pro-Palestinian protesters were arrested and suspended after taking over and occupying the office of Stanford University's president.\n\nStudents at the university in California took over and occupied the office of Stanford University President Richard Saller around 5:30 a.m. on Wednesday, according to the Stanford Daily. University officials reported that \"extensive graffiti vandalism\" had been left on the \"sandstone buildings and columns of the Main Quad,\" according to NBC News.\n\nOfficials confirmed to the outlet that thirteen people who had been inside the building had been arrested, while those who were students were \"immediately suspended.\"\n\nSeniors who were involved in the protest would \"not be allowed to graduate,\" officials added.\n\n\"We are appalled and deeply saddened by the actions that occurred on our campus earlier today,\" Saller and Stanford University Provost Jenny Martinez said in a joint statement, according to the outlet.\n\nPhotos posted to social media showed graffiti written on the buildings of Standford University saying, \"De@th 2 Isr@hell,\" \"F**k Amerikkka,\" and \"Free Palestine.\"\n\nA masked protester can be seen sitting in Saller's office in a video posted to X. The masked protester states that students are \"occupying President Richard Saller's office in light of the ongoing genocide in Gaza carried out by the Israeli government.\"\n\n\"We have three demands,\" the protester continues. \"First, we demand a divestment is put on the agenda of the Board of Trustees meeting on June 12 and 13. Second, we demand that Stanford disclose their 2022 financial year investments. Finally, we demand amnesty for all student protesters on Standford's campus.\"\n\nDuring the month of April and into early May, anti-Israel protesters at various college and university campuses across the nation started encampments and staged protests over the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.\n\nThe protests and encampments that flooded university campuses such as George Washington University, the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), the University of Vermont, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, among many others, were inspired by an initial encampment established at Columbia University on April 17.\n\nThe day after the encampment at Columbia University was suspended, several students were suspended and hundreds of protesters were arrested. Another encampment popped up in its place and remained until the New York Police Department (NYPD) conducted a raid of the campus after protesters seized control of an academic building.",

        "title": "Why Doesn't Australia Support Palestinian Statehood?",
        "body": "Australia's parliament voted against recognising Palestinian statehood last week, 80 votes to five. In the 24 hours since, a parliament petition calling on the government \"to take necessary measures to declare the recognition of the state of\n\nPalestine\" surpassed 70,000 signatures. But what does this actually mean and why is parliament so intent on holding back?\n\nTo recognise the state of Palestine means Australia would establish a diplomatic relationship with Palestine, for example, we would have an ambassador to Palestine like we do with Israel.\n\nBut\n\naccording to the Australia Palestine Advocacy Network, the symbolic meaning of recognising Palestine would be \"a declaration to Israel that it cannot dictate the terms of Palestine's relationship with Australia\".\n\nThe State of Palestine is\n\nrecognised by 146 countries around the world and Australia's came after Spain, Ireland and Norway joined the majority of nations who support Palestinian statehood. Also earlier this month, 143 out of 193 member states of the United Nations' general assembly voted in favour of Palestinian UN membership, which would recognise them as their own state. Australia was one of the nations that backed this bid, but ultimately our delegates knew Palestine was unlikely to be given this recognition because the US has and can use its veto power in the UN Security Council to block the move.\n\nThe Palestinian delegation will therefore, for now, keep its \"non-member observer state\" status.\n\nAt the time the government said \"the rejection of Hamas is amongst the reasons why Australia voted for this resolution\" because Hamas is pushing for Palestinian statehood and sovereignty.\n\nAustralia's position on Palestine seems inconsistent. We've also voted differently on a ceasefire since October 7,\n\none for and one abstention.\n\nSo our foreign affairs minister\n\nPenny Wong says her government supports Palestine's UN membership because it is anti-Hamas, but also voted against recognising Palestine as a state in our own legislation and policymaking.\n\nThis is because Australia supports a two-state solution.\n\nIn 1947, the UN General Assembly voted to recommend the partition of the British Mandate of Palestine into a Jewish State and an Arab State, endorsing the \"two States for two peoples\" principle.\n\nAustralia supported the partition of Palestine to create the state of Israel \"a Jewish national home\" something it promised in the\n\nBalfour Declaration after World War I. Back then, supporting the Zionist cause was mainly backed by Labor and opposed by conservatives. In 1948, Israel declared its own statehood, which Australia voted in the UN to support. Israel has been an ally of Australia ever since.\n\nToday, our\n\nofficial line is: Australia does not recognise a Palestinian state. We are committed to a two-state solution in which Israel and a future Palestinian state coexist, in peace and security, within internationally recognised borders.\n\nSo when the Greens introduced a motion to the House of Representatives to recognise the state of Palestine it was expected the vote would fail, only five MPs - four greens and one independent - voted in favour.\n\nGreens leader\n\nAdam Bandt said last week Australia had a moral responsibility to recognise Palestine, and that a vote for Palestinian statehood would have been \"a critical step towards peace and ending the slaughter that we are seeing with the invasion of Gaza right now\".\n\nBut he was also accused of\n\n\"wedge politics\" and dividing the community by Labor because he introduced the motion knowing it would fail due to the major parties' positions.\n\nBut as pressure builds from Australian voters and around the world, could the government follow the majority of nations and recognise Palestine?\n\nAleksandra Bliszczyk is the Deputy Editor of VICE Australia.

        "title": "Pakistan poised to secure eighth term in UNSC",
        "body": "UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan is poised to secure a record eighth term as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in Thursday's election.\n\nAll UN member nations are currently engaged in the process of filling five non-permanent seats on the 15-member Security Council. Among the contenders are Denmark, Greece, Pakistan, Panama, and Somalia, with each regional group presenting a single candidate in this uncontested race, known as a \"clean slate\".\n\nPakistan, representing the Asia-Pacific group alongside India, stands as a strong contender for one of the available seats. The elections are exclusive to the 10 non-permanent positions, as the UNSC's five permanent members -- Britain, China, France, Russia, and the United States -- do not undergo the electoral process.\n\nTraditionally, the allocation of the non-permanent seats follows a rotational method among regional groups. Consensus within these groups often determines the selected candidate.\n\nDenmark, Greece, Somalia, Panama among contenders in today's election for non-permanent seat\n\nNotably, India and Pakistan, despite their historical rivalry, frequently support each other's candidacies in these elections, reflecting diplomatic pragmatism amidst their differences.\n\nAll five candidates have served on the UNSC previously: Pakistan seven times, Panama five times, Denmark four times, Greece twice, and Somalia once.\n\nThe five seats available for 2024 election, according to the regular distribution, include one for the African group, one for the Asia-Pacific group, one for the Latin American and Caribbean group, and two seats for the Western European and Others group (WEOG). The five new members elected this year will take up their seats on Jan 1, 2025 and will serve until Dec 31, 2026.\n\nThe incoming members will inherit a world grappling with heightened tensions sparked by events like the war in Palestine and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. These conflicts have divided the Security Council as well, with key players advocating divergent positions on issues ranging from humanitarian crisis to disarmament.\n\nThe Palestinian conflict, in particular, has drawn sharp divisions among UNSC members, with the US staunchly supporting Israel's offensives in Gaza, while others condemning the Israeli actions as 'genocidal' and calling for an immediate ceasefire.\n\nOf the 11 draft resolutions concerning the situation that the UNSC has voted on since the outbreak of hostilities, it has adopted three at the time. The regional fallout from the war has also heightened tensions in other situations on the UNSC's agenda, including Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen.\n\nA UN statement, released in New York, noted that among the current candidates, Denmark, Greece, and Panama all enjoy strong relations with Israel and abstained on the October 27, 2023 General Assembly resolution calling for a humanitarian truce in Gaza. However, Panama also abstained on the Dec 12, 2023 UNGA resolution seeking immediate ceasefire, though Denmark and Greece voted in favour of this resolution.\n\nPakistan and Somalia -- both members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation -- voted in favour of both resolutions and have criticised Israel's conduct of the war. On May 10, all five candidate countries voted in favour of the UNGA resolution granting new \"rights and privileges\" to the State of Palestine and calling on the Security Council to reconsider the Palestinian request to become a UN member state.\n\nOn Ukraine, Pakistan abstained on all four resolutions, while Somalia voted in favour of the first and fourth and was absent from the second and third votes. \"On the Council, these two countries may seek a bridge-building role between Russia and Western members,\" the UN statement predicted.\n\n\"Pakistan is likely to engage actively on Afghanistan, from where the Pakistani Taliban -- a UN-designated terrorist group -- has staged cross-border attacks against Pakistan,\" the statement added.\n\nThe UN also highlighted Pakistan's role in peacekeeping, noting \"Pakistan is one of the UN's largest troop-contributing countries and is likely to take an active role on the issue as a Council member.\" The statement added Pakistan also emphasised its national counterterrorism efforts and \"may focus the council's attention on the threats posed by groups operating in its region\".",

        "body": "Acute food insecurity is set to increase in magnitude and severity in 18 hunger \"hotspots,\" including Nigeria, a new United Nations (UN) early warning report has revealed.\n\nThe report released recently spotlighted the urgent need of assistance to prevent famine in Gaza and the Sudan, and further deterioration in the devastating hunger crises in Haiti, Mali, and South Sudan.\n\nIt also warned about the lingering impact of El Niño and the looming threat of La Niña that risked bringing further climate extremes that could upend lives and livelihoods.\n\nIt stated, \"Since the previous edition of the Hunger Hotspots report (October 2023), the Central African Republic, Lebanon, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Zambia have joined Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Malawi, Somalia and Zimbabwe in the list of hunger hotspots, where acute food insecurity is likely to deteriorate further during the outlook period,\".\n\nThe report found that many hotspots faced growing hunger crises and highlighted the worrying multiplier effect that simultaneous and overlapping shocks were having on acute food insecurity. It noted that conflict, climate extremes and economic shocks continued to drive vulnerable households into food crises.\n\nThe report warned that 2023 was likely to mark the first year since 2010, in which humanitarian funding had declined compared to the previous year, but it still represented the second highest funding level ever for humanitarian assistance.\n\nFAO Director-General, QU Dongyu said, \"The daunting prospects highlighted in this report should serve as a wake-up call to all of us. We need to spearhead the shift from responding to crises after they occur to more proactive anticipatory approaches, prevention and resilience building to help vulnerable communities cope with upcoming shocks.\n\n\"Acting ahead of crises can save lives, reduce food shortages and protect livelihoods at a much lower cost than a not timely humanitarian response.\"\n\nOn his part, the WFP Executive Director, Cindy McCain said, \"Once a famine is declared, it is too late - many people will have already starved to death. In Somalia in 2011, half of the quarter of a million people who died of hunger perished before famine was officially declared.\n\n\"The world failed to heed the warnings at the time and the repercussions were catastrophic. We must learn the lesson and act now to stop these hotspots from igniting a firestorm of hunger,\" adding that: \"We have proven solutions to stop these crises in their tracks, but we need the resources and the political will to implement them at scale before more lives are lost.\"\n\nThe report also noted that ongoing conflict in Palestine was expected to further aggravate already catastrophic levels of acute hunger, with starvation and death already taking place, alongside the unprecedented death toll, widespread destruction and displacement of nearly the total population of the Gaza Strip.",

        "body": "BUREIJ, Palestinian Territories, June 6, 2024 (BSS/AFP) - Israel's military\n\npounded central Gaza with heavy air strikes on Wednesday as international\n\ntalks to secure a truce and hostage release deal resumed.\n\nTensions were high in annexed east Jerusalem as thousands of police guarded\n\nIsrael's annual \"flag march\" that has sparked clashes between Jews and Arabs\n\nin previous years.\n\nThe bloodiest ever Gaza war, sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern\n\nIsrael, raged on with jets bombing targets overnight and Palestinian\n\nofficials reporting yet more deaths.\n\nUrban combat and shelling intensified in Gaza's southern city of Rafah, while\n\nfighting resumed in central areas. The army announced targeted operational\n\nactivity in the areas of Bureij and eastern Deir al-Balah.\n\nBombardment of central Gaza killed 11 people near the Al-Maghazi camp and two\n\nnear Deir al-Balah, said witnesses and Palestinian officials.\n\nFamilies rushed the wounded, including children, to hospitals where civilians\n\nwere once more packing their belongings on pickup trucks and wheelchairs to\n\nflee.\n\nThe charity Medicines Sans Frontiers (MSF) said at least 70 dead and more\n\nthan 300 wounded, mostly women and children, had been brought to Al-Aqsa\n\nhospital since Tuesday, after \"heavy Israeli strikes\" in central Gaza.\n\nKarin Huster, an MSF medical adviser in Gaza, described the situation as\n\n\"overwhelming\".\n\n\"There are people lying everywhere on the floor, outside... bodies were being\n\nbrought in plastic bags,\" she said on X.\n\n- Sticking points -\n\nUS President Joe Biden on Friday outlined what he called a three-phase\n\nIsraeli plan to halt the fighting for six weeks while hostages are exchanged\n\nfor Palestinian prisoners and aid is stepped up.\n\nG7 powers and Arab states have backed the proposal, although sticking points\n\nremain -- Hamas insists on a permanent truce and full Israeli withdrawal,\n\ndemands that Israel has flatly rejected.\n\nA source with knowledge of the negotiations confirmed to AFP that a meeting\n\ntook place on Wednesday \"between the Qatari prime minister and head of\n\nEgyptian intelligence with Hamas in Doha to discuss a deal for a truce in\n\nGaza and the exchange of hostages and prisoners\".\n\nHamas political chief Ismael Haniyeh said Hamas would \"deal seriously and\n\npositively\" with any offer meeting those demands.\n\nBiden has urged Hamas to accept the deal and deployed CIA chief Bill Burns to\n\nQatar for a renewed push after months of negotiations.\n\nThe source said Burns would \"continue working with mediators on reaching an\n\nagreement between Hamas and Israel on a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of\n\nhostages\".\n\nQatar said Tuesday it had yet to see statements from either side \"that give\n\nus a lot of confidence\", but that it was \"working with both sides on\n\nproposals on the table\".\n\nBiden earlier told Qatar's emir that \"Hamas is now the only obstacle to a\n\ncomplete ceasefire\", and \"confirmed Israel's readiness to move forward\" with\n\nthe terms he set out last week.\n\nA senior Hamas official in Beirut on Tuesday accused Israel of seeking\n\n\"endless\" negotiations and reiterated the group's position rejecting any deal\n\nthat excludes a permanent ceasefire.\n\nMuhammad al-Najjar, a 35-year-old man from northern Gaza twice displaced by\n\nthe war, told AFP in Deir al-Balah: \"We just want to solve and end the\n\ncatastrophic situation that we are living. What matters to us is that the war\n\nmade us exhausted, destroyed us and destroyed everything in our lives.\"\n\n- Flashpoint Jerusalem march -\n\nIsraeli police deployed 3,000 officers in Jerusalem ahead of the annual march\n\nby right-wingers commemorating Israel's capture of the Old City in the 1967\n\nArab-Israeli war.\n\nThe march draws Israeli religious ultranationalists and Zionist youth groups\n\nand leads through the city's Muslim Quarter to the Western Wall. It has been\n\na lightning rod for Israeli-Palestinian tensions in recent years.\n\nThe latest Gaza war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern\n\nIsrael which resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians,\n\naccording to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nMilitants also took 251 hostages, 120 of whom remain in Gaza, including 41\n\nthe army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's bombardment and ground offensive have killed at least 36,586 people\n\nin Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health\n\nministry.\n\nIsrael has faced growing diplomatic isolation, cases against it before two\n\ninternational courts and several European governments, most recently\n\nSlovenia, recognising a Palestinian state.\n\nAmid the Gaza war, tensions have also spiralled elsewhere in the region\n\nbetween Israel and its allies on the one hand, and Iran-backed armed groups\n\nin Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen on the other.\n\nThe Israeli army and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement have traded near-daily\n\ncross-border fire, causing deaths, forcing mass evacuations and igniting\n\nwildfires on both sides.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that Israel was \"prepared\n\nfor a very intense operation\" along the border with Lebanon and that \"one way\n\nor another, we will restore security to the north\".\n\nWashington appeared to warn Israel against action on Wednesday, with the\n\nstate department saying that any \"escalation\" there would risk Israeli\n\nsecurity.\n\n\"We don't want to see that escalation of the conflict which would just lead\n\nto further loss of life from both Israelis and the Lebanese people and would\n\ngreatly harm Israel's overall security and stability in the region,\" said\n\nState Department spokesman Matthew Miller.\n\nThe UN, meanwhile, said it was \"obviously very concerned\" about tensions\n\nalong the border and called on all parties to de-escalate.\n\nThe violence since early October has killed at least 455 people in Lebanon,\n\nmostly fighters but including 88 civilians, according to an AFP tally. On the\n\nIsraeli side, the army says at least 14 soldiers and 11 civilians have been\n\nkilled.",

        "body": "Russia may send missiles closer to West Putin: West should read Russia's nuclear doctrine Western weapons hitting Russia is a step to war Putin: Russia will not attack NATO\n\nPutin, in his first face-to-face meeting with senior editors of international news agencies since the war in Ukraine began, said the West was wrong to assume Russia would never use nuclear weapons, and said the Kremlin's nuclear doctrine should not be taken lightly.\n\nWhen asked about NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg's calls to allow Ukraine to use Western weapons to strike Russian territory, Putin differentiated between different missiles but warned allowing Kyiv to strike Russia with ever more powerful weapons was a serious escalation that was drawing the West towards a war with Russia.\n\nRussia's response, the 71-year-old Kremlin chief said, would be to shoot down the Western missiles, and specifically mentioned U.S. ATACMS, and British and French missile systems.\n\nPutin also said Moscow was considering deploying similar high-technology, long-range missiles close enough to strike the states that allowed Ukraine to strike Russian territory with such missiles.\n\n\"If we see that these countries are being drawn into a war against the Russian Federation, then we reserve the right to act in the same way. In general, this is a path to very serious problems,\" Putin said.\n\nPutin did not give specifics of where he was considering delivering such missiles.\n\nPresident Joe Biden authorized Kyiv to launch some U.S.-supplied weapons at military targets inside Russia. Washington still prohibits Kyiv from striking Russia with ATACMS, which have a range of up to 186 miles (300 km), and other long-range U.S.-supplied weapons.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary David Cameron, during a visit to Kyiv on May 3, told Reuters Ukraine had a right to use the weapons provided by Britain to strike targets inside Russia, and it was up to Kyiv whether to do so.\n\nSpeaking to journalists for more than three hours at the newly built 81-floor Gazprom tower ahead of the annual St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, Putin touched on subjects from the war in Gaza to the upcoming U.S. election.\n\n\"No one in the United States is interested in Ukraine, they are interested in the greatness of the United States, which is fighting not for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, but for its own greatness.\"\n\nPutin said Russia did not care who the next U.S. president was but said the U.S. court system was clearly being used in a political battle against Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\n\"They are burning themselves from the inside, their state, their political system ... It is obvious all over the world that the prosecution of Trump, especially in court on charges that were formed on the basis of events that happened years ago, without direct proof, is simply using the judicial system in an internal political struggle,\" said Putin.\n\nMore than two years into the deadliest land war in Europe since World War Two, Putin is increasingly talking of the risk of a global conflict as the West grapples with what to do about the advance of Russian troops in Ukraine.\n\nWhen asked about the risk of nuclear war, Putin said Russia's nuclear doctrine allowed the use of such weapons.\n\n\"For some reason, the West believes that Russia will never use it,\" Putin said when asked by Reuters about the risk of nuclear escalation over Ukraine during more than three hours of questioning.\n\n\"We have a nuclear doctrine, look what it says. If someone's actions threaten our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we consider it possible for us to use all means at our disposal. This should not be taken lightly, superficially.\"\n\nRussia's published 2020 nuclear doctrine sets out the conditions under which a Russian president would consider using a nuclear weapon: broadly as a response to an attack using nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, or to the use of conventional weapons against Russia \"when the very existence of the state is put under threat.\"\n\nPutin casts the conflict in Ukraine as part of an existential battle with a declining and decadent West which he says humiliated Russia after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 by encroaching on what he considers Moscow's sphere of influence, including Ukraine.\n\nPutin said the West refused to speak about the causes of the war - which he said started in 2014 after a pro-Russian president was toppled in Ukraine's Maidan Revolution. Putin cast it as a U.S.-backed coup.\n\nThe West describes the invasion as an imperial-style land grab and has vowed to help Ukraine defeat Russian forces.\n\nUkraine says it will not rest until every last Russian soldier is ejected from the areas of Ukraine they control and which Moscow now considers to be parts of Russia.\n\nWestern leaders and Ukraine have played down Russia's warnings about the risk of a broader war involving Russia but have repeatedly warned Putin might attack a member of NATO, the world's most powerful military alliance.\n\nBoth Putin and Biden have said that a direct conflict between Russia, the world's biggest nuclear power, and U.S.-led NATO would be a step towards World War Three.\n\n\"You should not make Russia out to be the enemy. You're only hurting yourself with this, you know?\" Putin said.\n\n\"They thought that Russia wanted to attack NATO. Have you gone completely crazy? That is as thick as this table. Who came up with this? It is just complete nonsense, you know? Total rubbish.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Vladimir Soldatkin; Editing by Andrew Osborn and Lincoln Feast.)",

        "title": "How 'Israel' Has Lost The North",
        "body": "'Israel' has completely lost the north of occupied Palestine. It's under fire and on fire every day now. Hezbollah has methodically eye-poked 'Israel's' intelligence outposts and is literally blasting them in the nuts every day, on camera. The map above shows the new line of control for occupied Palestine, as reported by the thinking man's Der Stürmer, Haaretz. 'Israel' has lost it.\n\nEyes And Ears\n\nIt's fascinatingly boring how Hezbollah did this. For months their videos have been methodically mundane, blowing up this communication tower, that building, that listening station. It seemed like a bunch of nothing, but it adds up. Hezbollah had a list of 'Israel's' eyes and ears in the north and has spent months methodically eye poking them, like Odysseus and the Cyclops. Now -- however big the IOF might be -- they're effectively blinded.\n\nAs Hezbollah opens bigger and bigger gaps in 'Israel's' air defenses, they can send bigger and more missiles in, with better and better penetration. For 'Israel', this attrition is a compounding problem. Their air defenses are a connected system and the network is increasingly returning 404. Take for example, the destruction of the $230 million dollar SKYDEW blimp/spy balloon.\n\nThis balloon is designed to detect low-flying drones and missiles, especially important as this is the vector most used by the Resistance. SKYDEW can stay up much longer (and relatively cheaper) than planes, and can 'see' much further than ground-based systems. It was also placed in a highly strategic area that let them cover attacks from Syria, Iraq and -- to a lesser degree -- from Hezbollah, specifically on the port of Haifa. But now the party's over. Look at the balloon now:\n\nSKYDEW is now as shriveled and useless as Joe Biden's nutsack. This is a big loss, which also signals a big breakdown. As the SKYDEW 'Target Card' (from Hezbollah intelligence) says, it was \"protected by an electronic monitoring and jamming system against drones and UAVs (Drone Dome),\" and \"secured by three layers of missile interception systems: Iron Dome, David's Sling, and Hetz [Arrow].\" That all got sliced through like the layers of an onion, leaving only Zionist tears behind.\n\nThe northern front is porous now, and the 'settlers' more than anybody knows it. As Moshe Davidovitz -- head of the Asher regional council -- said, \"Ten rockets fell in the center of the country and the media is in an uproar -- the country is in turmoil,\" he wrote. \"But every day dozens of rockets are fired towards the confrontation line settlements and the Galilee, including anti-tank missiles and suicide drones, and the country remains silent. Once again, it's proof that the north is not being counted.\"\n\nHezbollah of course, has counted the north. They have a list of 'Israeli' military targets and they go through them one by one. Take, for example, the Mount Meron Air Surveillance Base, one of the two main bases in 'Israel'. This is what the IOF says about the base, in a 2016 article by Maariv (via translation):\n\nAnd this is what Hezbollah intelligence released, as they were bombing it:\n\nI know the demonic testicles of Meron Air Base well, having seen Hezbollah come at them like sperm to an egg, over and over in countless videos. They've been relentless. It honestly gets boring because the whole thing never fireballs, but each small hit adds up. Each time a hole in 'Israeli' air defenses opens, the hole only gets bigger, because of Hezbollah is damaging complex, interconnected systems.\n\nNow the Meron base can barely defend itself, let alone the region. 'Israel' has responded by assassinating Hezbollah (and Iranian) leaders, but the Resistance just names missiles after the martyrs and send more. This is a battle of attrition and Hezbollah is paying attention while 'Israel' is mindlessly lashing out. 'Israel' is completely distracted by a genocide in the south, and has lost the battle for the north.\n\nAfter months of this boring de-administrative work, Hezbollah has finally gotten to the good stuff. 'Israel's' northern air defenses today are like a ragged old mosquito net that the dog chased the cat through. It's full of holes, and big ones. Hezbollah can increasingly fire at will, with increasingly accurate weapons. For example, here is Hezbollah taking down a SKYSTAR 330 by drone-striking its Battalion 869 operator literally in the nuts.\n\nIn this case, Hezbollah targeted not the spy balloon itself, but the balloon controllers, in three locations at the same time. With the operators eliminated, the balloon drifted out of control, landing in Lebanon where some kids recovered it. This is the state of 'Israel's' eyes and ears in the north. They're on the ground.\n\nIron Done\n\n'Israel' has nothing worth calling an air-defense in the north anymore. The Iron Dome is done. Hezbollah can fire at will, and has for every single day for seven months now. Iraqi Resistance missiles are flying right over them, towards Haifa. Iran can overwhelm the entire national system whenever it wants. 'Israel' can still offend the conscience, but they're missile defenseless now. Even Hamas is hitting them, from within traumatized Gaza. It's open season, and the 'settlers' know it.\n\n'Israeli' settlers openly bemoan their unsettled state all over the Hebrew press. Some settlers were so Pyrrhicly pissed they threatened to secede from the entire abomi-nation and form the new State of Galilee. As The Jerusalem Post (the ethnic cleanser's preferred real estate supplement) said,\n\nThis is of course the worst that can happen. The entire premise of 'Israel' is that they can do whatever they want and fuck everyone else. If the Iron Dome doesn't work, 'Israel' doesn't work, and the Iron Dome doesn't work. It's the Iron Sieve now. Holy warriors have poked it full of holes\n\nThis is a huge problem because the Iron Dome is not just 'Israel's' physical defense mechanism, it's their psychological defense mechanism. It's what makes the whole colonial project believable, that they can piss off everyone in the region and suffer no consequences. Belief in the 'Iron Dome' is belief in 'Israel' and neither is believable anymore. Thus the northern 'settlements' have emptied out and they're not coming back anytime soon. As the Resistance News Network (RNN) said (on May 29th):\n\nLet's look at one example of Hezbollah eliminating one target, an Iron Dome battery. They systematically do this over and over. This Al Jazeera report describes how Hezbollah first gets the battery to reveal itself by firing bullshit at it, then hits it with the real shit:\n\nHezbollah has done this over and over, methodically hunting and seeking Iron Dome batteries one by one. Given that the rest of their surveillance equipment is decimated and they can't even see what's coming, 'Israel' has to then draw its military assets further and further from the border. Otherwise this is what happens:\n\nThis is the moment Hezbollah hits \"the garrison unit of Barkat Risha with an Iranian Almas top-attack ATGM [Anti-Tank Guided Missile].\" 'Israel' -- unlike Hezbollah and Hamas -- has not spent the last 20 years tunneling underground, so their soldiers are all exposed without the Iron Dome. Take also, for example, the IOF's 769th Brigade Headquarters, or what's left of it.\n\nThe colonial condom is full of holes and 'Israel' is pregnant with a Palestine reborn. When the soldiers leave, the settlers have to leave also, it's a total failure of colonization. This is not a strategic retreat, it's strategic defeat. This is not a solution, just dissolution. But it's all 'Israel' can do. They've lost control of the north and, worst of all, they've lost control of the tempo of this war. Hezbollah can keep turning the heat up and up until 'Israel' is cooked. Behold Kiryat Shmona (occupied al-Khalisa), which is literally on fire right now:\n\nThis is directly because the Iron Dome is not intercepting drones and Hezbollah has fire control of the whole region. Hence it burns. Settlers now see a 'welcome' board that's literally melting. The message is clear. 'Fuck off'.\n\nI have watched this process play out for the past seven months, and now the grapes of wrath bear fruit. Hezbollah has fire control over the north, while 'Israel' is retreating further and further. The collapse of the northern front also opens up 'Israel' for attack from Syria and Iraq, which can fly straight through. This is all causing massive psychological damage to 'Israel' because the Iron Dome was their safety blanket, and now they have to face the skeletons under their bed alone. This is all because Hezbollah had a strategy while 'Israel' was just ratchety, bombing ambulances and homes with no military value. Now 'Israel' has lost northern Palestine and it's not coming back. This is decolonization in action. 'Israel' has lost the north and a liberated Palestine is slowly coming into view.",

        "body": "Greens leader Adam Bandt has hit back at claims party MPs encouraged pro-Palestinian protests that led to electorate offices being damaged, as he threatens to sue the attorney-general for defamation.\n\nLabor and the coalition united in parliament on Wednesday to claim the Greens were stoking tensions over the conflict after some electorate offices were vandalised or barricaded by demonstrators.\n\nMr Bandt has accused Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus of making defamatory comments about him relating to the protests in a media interview following Question Time.\n\n\"My lawyers have written to the Attorney-General regarding what I consider to be defamatory statements he made about me and the Greens yesterday,\" he said in a statement on Thursday.\n\n\"I think that the first law officer of this country should not make utterly unfounded statements and spread misinformation. No politician should do that.\n\n\"I would prefer not to have to pursue these matters legally, and I hope the Attorney will respond in a proper way.\"\n\nSpeaking to the media on Thursday, Mr Bandt denied claims Greens MPs had encouraged violence or property damage at protests, labelling the criticism from the major parties as a distraction.\n\n\"Everyone deserves a safe workplace. There is no place for violence in this country, and we have made that crystal clear,\" he told reporters in Canberra.\n\n\"The prime minister is desperate to make it about anything other than the children who are dying in Gaza and the people who are being slaughtered.\"\n\nDuring debate in parliament, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese claimed the Greens had been spreading misinformation about the conflict in the Middle East.\n\n\"It is unacceptable that misinformation has been consciously and deliberately spread by some Green senators and MPs who have engaged in this demonstration outside offices and online,\" Mr Albanese said.\n\n\"As political leaders, we have a responsibility to lower temperature, not to fuel division.\"\n\nOpposition Leader Peter Dutton told Sydney radio station 2GB he condemned the conduct of the Greens, accusing the party of being \"central\" to university campus protests and the distribution of anti-Semitic messages.\n\n\"People need to have a conversation with their kids and their grandkids and their next-door neighbours about how evil the current Greens party is,\" he said.\n\nFinance Minister Katy Gallagher said the Greens had been misrepresenting the government's response to the conflict in the Middle East.\n\n\"We've been clear about our concern for the people of Gaza, the fact that we've been calling for a ceasefire, the fact we've been calling for more humanitarian assistance to go and to go quickly,\" she told ABC TV.\n\nLiberal MP Julian Leeser on Thursday spoke about rising levels of anti-Semitism in Australia following the October 7 attacks on Israel by Hamas, which killed 1200 people and resulted in 200 people being taken hostage.\n\nIsrael's counter-offensive has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians and injured more than 80,000 people, according to Gaza's health ministry.\n\nMr Leeser said he was frustrated with the government, universities and other bodies being \"unable to say anti-Semitism without saying Islamophobia in the same breath\".\n\n\"Jewish Australians are so sick and tired of the moral equivalence, particularly because so many Jewish Australians are always at the forefront pushing back against the bigotry against other groups,\" he said.",

The tunnel route was approximately two kilometers long and connected to several other routes in the area.\n\nThe tunnel that was located was reportedly extensive and contained blast doors, which were storing weapons such as AK-47s, anti-tank missiles, many intelligence assets, and explosives.\n\nAdditionally, the combat teams of the 7th Brigade and the Kfir Brigade began a divisional operation under the 98th Division over the past day in eastern Bureij and eastern Deir al-Balah simultaneously.\n\nThe troops operated against terrorist infrastructure above and below ground in the area and destroyed rocket launch areas. The troops gained operational control of the region, killed terrorists from the ground and the air, and located several tunnel shafts, the IDF added.\n\nHours after the start of the operation, the 7th Brigade Combat Team located a ready-to-launch mortar shell launcher hidden under a post with a UN symbol on it near the border fence.",

        "title": "Erdogan turns up the heat on Israel as his party's popularity wanes",
        "body": "ISTANBUL - Since the war in Gaza began, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been one of Israel's harshest and most vocal critics - routinely branding it a terror state, comparing its prime minister to Hitler and heaping praise on Hamas. The Palestinian militant group is considered a terror group by most members of NATO, but not Turkey. Some Western critics might accuse Erdogan of going too far in supporting Hamas, but recent events suggest he has not yet appeased his domestic political base. After Erdogan's ruling party was handed a humbling defeat in local elections in March, he promised to think hard about what went wrong. Beyond the sputtering Turkish economy - many pundits blamed the electoral setback on his stance on Israel and its war in Gaza.\n\nPolitical challengers, like the smaller, ultra-conservative New Welfare party, managed to siphon off votes from the president's ruling AK Party by taking a tougher stance against Israel and demanding concrete actions beyond the fiery rhetoric Erdogan is known for. \"We do not see (the government) doing anything other than speaking and condemning. There are no sanctions, no concrete steps taken, trade with Israel still continues,\" said New Welfare's leader Fatih Erbakan in March.\n\nThe president may have believed that strong rhetoric against Israel was enough, Seda Demiralp, a political scientist at Isik University, told CNN after the election. \"Erdogan really underestimated New Welfare and how much New Welfare could mobilize conservative voters.\"\n\nAfter the election, Erdogan wasted little time correcting course, swiftly moving to match words with actions. In a matter of days, some trade with Israel was cut off. Three weeks later, all trade was cut off. Some $7 billion worth of annual trade - mostly Turkish exports - is now on pause until the war is over.\n\nThat wasn't all. Last month, Turkey announced its intention to join the genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice. Already warm ties with Hamas were made even warmer when Erdogan hosted the group's political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Istanbul on April 20, and posed with him for pictures.\n\nErdogan has compared Hamas to the \"Kuvayi Milliye,\" the nationalist militias that fought against foreign occupation during the Turkish War of Independence after World War I. \"Believe me, if it were 100 years ago, they would also call Kuvayi Milliye a terrorist organization, a rebel, a joke, a traitor,\" Erdogan said in a speech to party lawmakers in May, according to state broadcaster TRT. \"This nation has always stood by the oppressed.\" The gap between how Turkey and its NATO allies view Hamas was on full, awkward display when Erdogan hosted Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis last month in Ankara.\n\n\"I don't see Hamas as a terrorist organization,\" Erdogan declared. \"On the contrary, Hamas is an organization of resistance, whose territories have been occupied since 1947 and which has been defending its territories after the occupation... If you call them a 'terrorist organization,' it will upset us.\"\n\n\"We can agree to disagree on this topic,\" Mitsotakis replied.\n\nErdogan went on to claim that \"over 1,000 Hamas members are now under treatment in our hospitals in Turkey.\"\n\nA Turkish official with knowledge of the situation has since told CNN the president misspoke. \"He meant 1,000 Gazans are under treatment, who aren't Hamas members,\" the official said.\n\nSince the war began, the Turkish Ministry of Health has made several medical airlifts of injured Gazans and their family members to hospitals in Turkey.\n\nFor Erdogan, 'Hamas is Palestine'\n\nExperts say the comment made by Erdogan in the presence of the Greek leader may have in fact been intended for an audience closer to home.\n\n\"Western leaders right now are very aware that Erdogan is basically talking for his domestic audience and for the Muslim neighborhood,\" said Evren Balta, an international relations professor at Ozyegin University in Istanbul.\n\nDomestically, she said, the president has managed to link Hamas and the Palestinians to the point that \"when you are criticizing Hamas publicly, it is as if you're criticizing the Palestinian cause.\"\n\nThat, coupled with the strong affinity the Turkish public has with Palestinians, has led politicians of all stripes to tread carefully on the issue, particularly some secular and nationalist opposition parties.\n\n\"For Erdogan, Hamas is Palestine. For the opposition, Hamas is not Palestine, but they are having difficulties framing the political discourse,\" Balta said.\n\nAt a political rally ahead of the March local elections, Ozgur Ozel, leader of the secular CHP party established by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, highlighted his party's longstanding support for the Palestinian cause and sought to counter claims that he regards Hamas as a terrorist organization.\n\n\"I have not called Hamas a terrorist organization, but I have condemned its terrorist attacks,\" he said. \"I also condemned Israel's state terrorism.\"\n\nHe then went on to taunt the president. \"Now come on, Erdogan. If you are on Palestine's side, stop the trade that your relatives, children, supporters and friends do with Israel every day.\"\n\nAfter the elections, Istanbul's CHP mayor Ekrem Imamoglu - widely touted as a future presidential contender - took fierce criticism from political rivals and in the Turkish press for branding Hamas as a terrorist organization in an interview with CNN in April. This was despite his harsh condemnation of Israel and its \"brutal oppression\" of Palestinians.\n\n'No influence' on NATO\n\nTurkey's NATO allies in the West have been quick to condemn Hamas, but they've been largely silent on Ankara's cozy relations with the group.\n\n\"I think there is a degree of discomfort,\" about the relationship, said Fabrice Pothier, a former NATO policy chief, who now leads the Rasmussen Global political consultancy. \"It is not benign, that there is one major ally that is far away from the others, but I think NATO manages - up to a point - to compartmentalize between the bilateral positions or issues of allies, and the NATO collective positions and issues.\"",

        "body": "Good morning. A new Texas Stock Exchange announced yesterday that it had raised $120 million from investors including BlackRock and Citadel Securities in an effort to launch a new domestic rival to the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.\n\nTXSE Group has raised capital from more than two dozen prominent investors and business leaders across the country in hopes of becoming the best-capitalized stock market player seeking recognition from federal regulators, a declared James Lee, its president and CEO published on LinkedIn.\n\nLee said the exchange will be headquartered in Dallas and plans to begin processing its first transactions in 2025 and its first listing in 2026. Learn more about how the new exchange plans to challenge the NYSE and Nasdaq.\n\nHere's what else I'm keeping an eye on:\n\nFive other headline news\n\n1. The United States is ready to provide a $50 billion loan to Ukraine, repaid with profits from frozen Russian assets, if the EU can extend sanctions against Moscow indefinitely. according to a leaked discussion paper. Washington is pushing for an agreement on its proposal before the G7 leaders' summit in Italy next week, where the financing mechanism is expected to be the centerpiece of support for Ukraine. Read the full, exclusive story.\n\n2. De Beers boss wants to transform mining company into major luxury jewelry retailer as it recovers from its worst year in more than two decades. Although the company sells diamond jewelry in retail stores around the world through its boutiques, its chief executive, Al Cook, told the FT it plans to double the number of outlets to expand into the territory of profitable luxury brands such as Tiffany and Cartier. Here's more on Cook's plan to build a mining-to-retail operation.\n\n3. Elliott Management has rebuilt a substantial stake in SoftBank and is pushing the Japanese tech conglomerate founded by Masayoshi Son to launch a $15 billion stock buyback. The U.S.-based activist funds' position is worth more than $2 billion and has worked directly with SoftBanks senior management over the past two to three months, according to people familiar with the matter. Elliott's investment is the second time he has targeted the Sons company.\n\n4. China has become one of the largest bilateral infrastructure lenders to the Philippines. According to a new report released by AidData, a research laboratory at the University of William & Mary, China committed a total of $9.1 billion in public financing to the Philippines between 2000 and 2022. The findings illustrate the special role that plays the financial power of China in the south. -East Asia, even as governments in the region attempt to balance economic dependence on their larger neighbor with their political and security interests. Here are other findings from the report.\n\n5. Joe Biden accused Benjamin Netanyahu of prolonging the war in Gaza, saying that there is every reason for people to conclude that the Israeli Prime Minister did this to stay in power. The US president's comments will increase pressure on Netanyahu to defy far-right critics of his coalition and support Biden's plan to end the war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nThe big read\n\nThe series of new tariffs imposed by the United States and Europe against Chinese electric vehicles are forcing major Chinese automakers to focus more on other sectors. But the unintended result of this growing protectionism could lead to Chinese dominance not only over other Western economies that are less protectionist, but also over the world's most important emerging markets, such as Southeast Asia, America Latin and the Middle East.\n\nWe also read and listened...\n\nChart of the day\n\nNarendra Modi is expected to begin negotiations to form a government with smaller allied partners, a day after the Indian prime minister suffered his biggest political setback after a decade in power. Final results from the six-week election were released overnight and showed the BJP losing its majority for the first time since 2014.\n\nTake a break from the news\n\nLooking for things to do in Melbourne?

        "body": "Subjects: Introduction of legislation to ban deepfakes material, eSafety Commissioner v X Corp, regulation of social media, Gaza conflict.\n\nRAF EPSTEIN: The Federal Government is going to have significant gaol penalties for the creators and sharers of deepfake porn. Mark Dreyfus joins us. He is the Attorney-General in Anthony Albanese's Government and also the MP for Isaacs in Melbourne's south east. Good morning.\n\nATTORNEY-GENERAL MARK DREYFUS: Good morning Raf, and good morning to your listeners.\n\nEPSTEIN: Does this mean a 14-year-old kid could go to gaol for sharing an image?\n\nATTORNEY-GENERAL: This is dealing with non-consensual sharing of sexualised, deep fake images. That's the legislation I introduced yesterday. So, it's material that's shared without consent. And we know it's a damaging and deeply distressing form of abuse. If a 14-year-old child is sharing that kind of information, potentially yes, they could be charged but they would be dealt with as children are dealt with in the criminal law.\n\nEPSTEIN: So a kid could go to gaol...\n\nATTORNEY-GENERAL: Children are treated differently to adults.\n\nEPSTEIN: But a kid could go to gaol for sharing this?\n\nATTORNEY-GENERAL: It's most unlikely. This is targeting the people who are sharing and also those who are creating this kind of sexualised deepfake images.\n\nEPSTEIN: And do you think it's fair if someone, a teenager potentially, faces gaol for something like this? I guess I'm asking you if you think that's appropriate.\n\nATTORNEY-GENERAL: Well, that's going to be a matter for courts but by and large children are not gaoled in Australia. The police will obviously excise discretion in what they investigate and how they apply these newly created offences. But we've got here behaviour that affects women and girls who are the target of this kind of deeply offensive and harmful behaviour. We know that it can inflict deep and long-lasting harm on victims. The Albanese Government has no tolerance for this kind of criminal behaviour and that's why we are legislating in this clear way.\n\nEPSTEIN: And coming at it from the other way, you can't get Facebook to reveal the identity of drug dealers at the moment, or I should say police can't force Facebook to reveal people's identities. Why are Facebook going to suddenly tell police who created an image?\n\nATTORNEY-GENERAL: We've got a whole range of powers and I'm not sure that that's right what you said. We've got a range of powers, warrant-based powers, that enable the discovery of who is publishing what and when and who is operating in a digital environment.\n\nEPSTEIN: It's very difficult to do that though, isn't it?\n\nATTORNEY-GENERAL: I'm not disputing that it's difficult Raf. But the fact that it's difficult to find someone shouldn't prevent us creating a criminal offence. There's a whole lot of crimes that are difficult to detect and difficult to prosecute but that does not stop us from legislating to ban those activities and doing what we can to eliminate the conduct. You have to remember that criminal law also has a function of sending a message to the community of what kind of behaviour is unacceptable.\n\nEPSTEIN: And I think a lot of people might back you in sending that message, I just wonder if it's effective. There's no doubt there's people committing a tonne of crimes online. They are not prosecuted. They are not identified. All governments struggle to stop people getting radicalised online. Is this law actually going to be effective given how much fake video there could be out there?\n\nATTORNEY-GENERAL: I can point to the fact that we've been able to prosecute people for child sex abuse material online, we've been able to prosecute people for terrorist activities online, that there is a reach of the criminal law and our police into the digital world. I can say all that and at the same time recognise that it's difficult, Raf. So, I accept that it's difficult but it doesn't mean it's impossible. And there are examples of our police, particularly the Australian Federal Police is highly skilled in technological interventions and technological detection. We think that these offences are very much worth creating. And I am confident that the Australian Federal Police, with whom we have worked to create these offences, their input will make sure that it's going to be a workable law.\n\nEPSTEIN: Just on how easy or difficult that is to sort of try and rein in the social media companies, I just want to replay this from the eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant. She was trying to take down the video of the church stabbing. She took X or Twitter to court and Elon Musk's personal interventions, according to her, lead to threats directed at her and her family. Here she is.\n\nINMAN GRANT: He issued a dog whistle to 181 million users around the globe which resulted in death threats directed at me, which resulted in doxxing of my family members, including my three children. So I think with great power comes great responsibility.\n\nEPSTEIN: As Attorney-General, do you think she's right that Elon Musk's dog whistling led directly to threats against her?\n\nATTORNEY-GENERAL: Well, it's shocking that any Australian regulator, that the eSafety Commissioner or any other Australian public servants should be threatened, let alone that their families should be put at risk in that way. That's completely unacceptable that anyone should engage in that conduct.\n\nEPSTEIN: But do you think she's right? That Elon Musk, whatever he said, she's saying whatever he put on his own platform directly led to the threat. Is she right?\n\nATTORNEY-GENERAL: I haven't seen what Elon Musk put on the platform. She's the eSafety regulator. She's an independent regulator and she's not directed by government. She's been doing her best to exercise the powers that are available to her under the Online Safety Act to make sure that everyone is safe online and she shouldn't be exposed to threats.\n\nEPSTEIN: So what might come after, and again, I'm not against trying to stop things like deepfake porn, I'm just curious about where you will go next. What else is the Government interested in trying to enforce online that you haven't enforced yet?\n\nATTORNEY-GENERAL: Everyone needs to be safe online Raf. And Australian parents, in particular, are very worried about the material that's available on social media. The harms potentially being caused, particularly to children, but harms generally about the range of misinformation and disinformation, the proliferation of scams or deepfakes which we're trying to deal with, other dangerous content. Digital platforms need to do a lot more to keep their users safe. My colleague, the Minister for Communications is working on a whole range of measures I think I'd leave it up to her to deal with the particular measures that she's looking at which include a review of the Online Safety Act.\n\nEPSTEIN: Don't you need a hell of a lot more? And again, none of the ideas are bad, but you need huge resources and tonnes of people to begin to enforce the sorts of things you're talking about, don't you?\n\nATTORNEY-GENERAL: That's why we're working through this. It's clearly something, and this has been the case since the beginning of time, it's for parents to make sure that their children are as safe as possible, to try and control what their children are looking at online. I've heard you talking online about all sorts of measures that parents can take about kids looking at their devices in public areas of the home and having a real think about what age you might give one of your children a device on which they can access the Internet and all those things. There is a limit to how much government can do but equally, my colleague, the Minister for Communications and the rest of the government are looking hard at just what is available in order to regulate what has been a pretty unregulated space. And we're hearing more and more about the harm that social media can do when you've got some terrible material that's now available.\n\nEPSTEIN: So, you've listed a large range of harms and a large range of problems, when will you have succeeded? What's the Government's KPIs? A thousand posts removed or ten people jailed? When will you be able to say you've done something significant?\n\nATTORNEY-GENERAL: It's a matter for the entire community to look at the way in which social media was operating. Perhaps there's no point at which you can say that you're completely successful. I would regard it as success with the measure that I introduced legislation for yesterday, that we no longer see non-consensual sharing of sexualised deepfake images because it's incredibly distressing behaviour. It overwhelmingly affects women and girls and I'd like it to stop. And I think anyone who's been touched by it would want it to stop and people who have become aware of it would want it to stop.\n\nEPSTEIN: News Corporation, they sort of made a play on this yesterday. Michael Miller runs a lot of that operation in Australia, he was saying yesterday that the social media companies monetise misery that they monetise misery. How do you hear that coming from a company like News Corp?\n\nATTORNEY-GENERAL: There's been a lot of criticism of the way News Corp has conducted its business as well and every everyone in the media has a responsibility in what they publish. Everyone in the media has a responsibility to make sure that what they are publishing is accurate, that it doesn't needlessly stir up disharmony in the community. Everyone in the media has a responsibility to not publish misinformation and disinformation. So if Mr Miller is to be taken as offering a general commentary about the behaviour of media companies, that's a good thing. Let's hope that his own media company can keep to those standards.\n\nEPSTEIN: And just a final question on your own internal issues. Israel and Palestine, they're pretty difficult things for any group to argue. But isn't there a bit of a double standard in the Labor Party? Josh Burns criticised the government's policy on the Middle East. He seems to be allowed to . Fatima Payman from WA criticised the government's policy and gets punished. Isn't that a double standard?\n\nATTORNEY-GENERAL: Every person in public life in Australia has got a responsibility to bring the community together. Not to divide it. I'd urge everyone participating in this debate about the shocking events that have occurred in the Middle East starting with the massacre of October the seventh, everyone commenting has got a responsibility to think about the language that they're using. Think about not directing personal attacks. Think about not raising prejudice and hatred in the community.\n\nEPSTEIN: Are you saying that's what Fatima Payman did?\n\nATTORNEY-GENERAL: I'm not saying that about Fatima Payman. I'm not saying that's what Fatima Payman.\n\nEPSTEIN: That was the question.\n\nATTORNEY-GENERAL: In no sense am I saying that about Fatima Payman or about Josh Burns. I am not commenting on anyone in particular. I'm offering you a general comment about the way in which people participating in public life need to be careful about what they say and need to be careful about not spreading disinformation and misinformation. We need to be trying to bring the community together, not to divide it and not blame members of the Australian community for events occurring on the other side of the world in a horrible conflict that many, many Australians are very concerned about. But let's not turn on each other when we are trying to debate and discuss the events in the Middle East.\n\nEPSTEIN: Appreciate your time this morning. Thank you.\n\nATTORNEY-GENERAL: Thanks very much Raf.\n\n/Public Release.

        "body": "ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari has emphasized the need to build \"technology highways\" in the country by improving students' access to information technology infrastructure, bolstering educational programs, and equipping them with modern skills to fully benefit from the knowledge economy.\n\n\"Providing laptops to students would increase their access to education, bridge the digital divide, and equip them with technology skills to help them compete in the national and international job markets,\" he expressed these views while talking to Professor Dr Niaz Ahmad Akhtar, Vice Chancellor of Quaid-i-Azam University (QAU) Islamabad, who called on him at Aiwan-e-Sadr on Wednesday.\n\nThe Vice Chancellor of QAU briefed the President about the role of QAU in providing quality education, its programmes, and the administrative affairs of the University.\n\nTalking to the Vice Chancellor, President Asif Ali Zardari said that Pakistan was blessed with human resources, which needed to be converted into strength by imparting the latest education and skills.\n\nHe highlighted that Pakistan needed to train and educate its human resources, which could be exported to foreign countries facing a shortage of trained professionals to help Pakistan earn foreign exchange.\n\nThe President stated that universities were pivotal in producing skilled professionals, who could fulfil local and international market needs. He remarked that Pakistan needed to focus on producing more professionals such as doctors, engineers, nurses, and teachers.\n\nDuring the meeting, the Vice Chancellor informed that QAU was one of the top-ranking universities in Pakistan and was at 315th position in global rankings.\n\nHe apprised that the QAU was focusing on research that could have a positive impact on society, adding that digitalization was the priority of the University.\n\nPresident Asif Ali Zardari urged the need to further improve the quality of education, besides focusing on the character-building of students. He said that top position holders of QAU should be given Presidential Awards with cash to encourage in their studies.\n\nThe President appreciated the role of QAU in Pakistan's academic sector and assured the Vice Chancellor of his support in handling the financial issues of the University.\n\nMeanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari on Wednesday said that Pakistan and Jordan enjoyed close cordial relations and stressed further strengthening of bilateral ties between the two countries. The president expressed these views during a meeting with the Ambassador of Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to Pakistan Dr Maen Khreasat who called on him at Aiwan-e-Sadr on Wednesday.\n\nThe Jordanian ambassador extended an invitation to the president to attend a conference on humanitarian relief efforts in Gaza, scheduled to take place in Jordan on June 11. President Asif Ali Zardari assured him of Pakistan's participation in the conference. The ambassador apprised the president that Jordan had signed a MoU with the Akhuwat Foundation for relief assistance to Palestinians.\n\nThe president lauded Jordan for its efforts to provide relief in Palestine.\n\nThe ambassador also conveyed a felicitation message from the Jordanian King to President Asif Ali Zardari on assuming his office.Also, President Asif Ali Zardari has felicitated President Claudia Sheinbaum on her historic election as the first woman President of Mexico.\n\nIn a post on social media platform X, President Zardari said he is proud to share that Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto was the first woman Prime Minister of the Muslim World, who struggled for democracy and women empowerment.\n\nPresident Zardari said he is looking forward to further strengthening our bilateral ties under your leadership.

        "title": "Gaza Strikes and Ceasefire Tensions: A Grim Reality | Law-Order",
        "body": "Israel targeted a Gaza school, claiming it housed Hamas fighters but resulting in the deaths of at least 27 civilians. Amidst failed ceasefire negotiations, Hamas demands a permanent end to the conflict. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu faces political pressure, while Biden's ceasefire efforts falter.\n\n* Israeli military says jets hit Gaza school \"eliminating\" Hamas fighters\n\n* Gaza government media says at least 27 people seeking shelter killed, no Hamas compound in school\n\n* Apparent setback for Biden ceasefire proposal as Hamas leader demands permanent end to war\n\nBy Nidal al-Mughrabi and James Mackenzie CAIRO/JERUSALEM, June 6 (Reuters) -\n\nIsrael targeted a Gaza school on Thursday that it said contained an Hamas compound, killing fighters involved in the Oct. 7 attack that sparked the eight-month war, but Gaza media said the strike killed at least 27 people seeking shelter. Ismail Al-Thawabta, the director of the Hamas-run government media office, rejected Israel's claims that the U.N. school in Nuseirat, in central Gaza, had hidden a Hamas command post.\n\n\"The occupation uses lying to the public opinion through false fabricated stories to justify the brutal crime it conducted against dozens of displaced people,\" Thawabta told Reuters. Israel's military said that before the strike by Israeli fighter jets, the military took steps to reduce the risk of harm to civilians.\n\nIsrael has said there will be no halt to fighting during ceasefire talks. In an apparent blow to a truce proposal touted last week by U.S. President Joe Biden, the leader of Hamas on Wednesday said the group would demand a permanent end to the war in Gaza and Israeli withdrawal as part of a ceasefire plan.\n\nThe remarks by Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh appeared to deliver the Palestinian militant group's reply to the proposal that Biden unveiled last week. Washington had said it was waiting to hear an answer from Hamas to what Biden described as an Israeli initiative. \"The movement and factions of the resistance will deal seriously and positively with any agreement that is based on a comprehensive ending of the aggression and the complete withdrawal and prisoners swap,\" Haniyeh said.\n\nAsked whether Haniyeh's remarks amounted to the group's reply to Biden, a senior Hamas official replied to a text message from Reuters with a \"thumbs up\" emoji. Washington is still pressing hard to reach an agreement. CIA director William Burns met senior officials from mediators Qatar and Egypt on Wednesday in Doha to discuss the ceasefire proposal.\n\nSince a brief week-long truce in November, all attempts to arrange a ceasefire have failed, with Hamas insisting on its demand for a permanent end to the conflict, while Israel says it is prepared to discuss only temporary pauses until the militant group is defeated. Biden has repeatedly declared that ceasefires were close over the past several months, only for no truce to materialise.\n\nLast week's announcement came with far greater fanfare from the White House, and at a time when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under mounting domestic political pressure to chart a path to end the eight-month-old war and negotiate the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. Hamas, which rules Gaza, precipitated the war by attacking Israeli territory on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Around half of the hostages were freed in the war's only truce so far, which lasted a week in November.\n\nIsrael's military assault on Gaza has killed more than 36,000 people, according to health officials in the territory, who say thousands more dead are feared buried under the rubble. ISRAEL LUKEWARM\n\nAlthough Biden described the ceasefire proposal as an Israeli offer, Israel's government has been lukewarm in public. A top Netanyahu aide confirmed on Sunday Israel had made the proposal even though it was \"not a good deal\". Far-right members of Netanyahu's government have pledged to quit if he agrees to a peace deal that leaves Hamas in place, a move that could force a new election and end the political career of Israel's longest-serving leader.\n\nCentrist opponents who joined Netanyahu's war cabinet in a show of unity at the outset of the conflict have also threatened to quit, saying his government has no plan. Meanwhile, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said there would be no let-up in Israel's offensive while negotiations over the ceasefire proposal were under way.\n\n\"Any negotiations with Hamas would be conducted only under fire,\" Gallant said in remarks carried by Israeli media after he flew aboard a warplane to inspect the Gaza front. Israel announced a new operation against Hamas in central Gaza on Wednesday, where Palestinian medics said airstrikes had killed dozens of people.\n\nThe armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they had fought gun battles with Israeli forces on Wednesday in areas throughout the enclave and fired anti-tank rockets and shells. Two children were among the dead laid out on Wednesday in the city's Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, one of the last hospitals functioning in Gaza. Mourners said the children had been killed along with their mother, who had been unable to leave when others in the neighbourhood did.\n\n\"This is not war, it is destruction that words are unable to express,\" said their father Abu Mohammed Abu Saif.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "title": "Former Meta employee says he was fired for defending pro-Palestinian content on Instagram",
        "body": "Ex-Meta employee has claims that he was fired for attempting to address bugs that stifled pro-Palestinian content on Instagram.\n\nSocial media platforms have had to tread a fine line when it comes to posts related to the Russia-Ukraine war or the Israel-Palestine war. There has been criticism of Facebook, Instagram over posts about these critical issues. Now, a former Meta employee has accused the company of wrongful termination.\n\nAccording to a report by Business Insider, Ferras Hamad, ex-Meta employee has claims that he was fired for attempting to address bugs that stifled pro-Palestinian content on Instagram.\n\nHamad has filed a lawsuit against Meta in a California court, alleging discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and wrongful termination against Meta.\n\nNotably, Hamad is a Palestinian American and has been working as a software engineer on Meta's machine learning team since 2022. The employee claimed that he had received \"glowing performance reviews,\" but faced challenges when he raised concerns about content from Palestinian creators and activists being curbed or censored on Instagram.\n\nHamad was assigned to investigate Instagram's filters related to content from Gaza, Israel, and Ukraine sometime in October. This was soon after Hamas had attacked Israel. In the lawsuit, Hamad alleged that he found a lot of pro-Palestinian creators' posts were curbed, censored or their posts were being artificially limited. When he spoke to other colleagues about these \"irregularities\", many of them asked him to stop investigating into the matter.\n\nMeta informed Hamad in January that he was under investigation. According to the lawsuit, he was fired shortly after.\n\nOn its part Meta hasn't commented on the issues raised by Hamad in the lawsuit but said that he was fired for violating data policies. \"The employee was dismissed for violating Meta's data access policies, which we make clear to employees will result in immediate termination,\" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to Business Insider.",

They have to finish it quickly, strongly, and they have to get back to life again because it's taking too long. They have to finish the job.\"\n\nThe former president then claimed, \"I have people now telling me they don't think the [October 7] attack ever happened.\"\n\nHe argued:\n\nYou watch these people on television and they're now just like you have holocaust deniers also. They say the Holocaust never- it's the exact same people. They're saying it never happened. AOC plus three, you know? Israel was the most powerful lobby in the country 15 years ago. Today, between Tlaib and AOC and all of these people, what they're doing, Israel, they don't have the backing that they once had.\n\nHannity replied, \"You'll give it to them.\"\n\n\"I'm good. I'm good,\" Trump insisted. \"But they don't have the backing. Even Schumer, he's become like a Palestinian.

        "title": "European Parliament election: How are the polls conducted, who can vote?",
        "body": "Voters in the European Union are set elect lawmakers for the bloc's parliament, in a major democratic exercise that's also likely to be overshadowed by online disinformation. AP File\n\nYes, the big Indian election is over. Now the focus has shifted to the European Parliament, where voting will take place from 6 June to 9 June in of the biggest global democratic events this year.\n\nAs many as 400 million citizens are ready to vote this time in the EU elections. There is a lot at stake. Voters are concerned about the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, the European economy and jobs.\n\nAmid this, political parties try to garner more power and the voters' trust. Currently, the biggest question is whether European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will continue to be in the role or be replaced.\n\nWhen will the elections be held for the European Parliament?\n\nThis will be the 10th parliamentary election to be held for the 27-member bloc. Voting is scheduled to take place from 6 June to 9 June. Results can only be revealed on the evening of 9 June, once polling stations have closed in all member states.\n\nHow does the election work?\n\nThe elections will begin on a Thursday in the Netherlands and conclude on a Sunday, when most countries hold the polls. The voting is done by direct universal suffrage in a single ballot.\n\nThe number of members elected in each country depends on the size of the population. It ranges from six for Malta, Luxembourg and Cyprus to 96 for Germany. In 2019, Europeans elected 751 lawmakers. Following the United Kingdom's departure from the EU in 2020, the number of MEPs (member of European Parliament) fell to 705. Some of the 73 seats previously held by British MEPs had been redistributed to other member states.\n\nAfter the election, the European Parliament will have 15 additional members, bringing the total to 720. Twelve countries will get extra MEPs. Elections are contested by national political parties, but once they are elected, most of the lawmakers then join transnational political groups.\n\nWho is eligible to vote?\n\nInterestingly, people under 18 are allowed to vote in some countries. In Belgium, a law formed in 2022 lowered the minimum voting age to 16 while Germany, Malta and Austria are also permitting 16-year-olds to vote. In Greece, the youngest voting age is 17. In all other member states, the age remains 18. A minimum age is also required to stand for election -- from 18 in most countries to 25 in Italy and Greece.\n\nWhat will be voter turnout?\n\nEuropean Union elections usually don't bring a huge turnout, but there was a clear upturn in public interest in the 2019 election. At 50.7 per cent, the turnout was eight points higher than in 2014 after steadily falling since 1979, when it reached 62 per cent. In April, the latest edition of the European Parliament's Eurobarometer highlighted a surge of interest in the upcoming election. Around 71 per cent of Europeans said they are likely to cast a ballot.\n\nWhat are the main issues facing European Parliament?\n\nRussia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine is at the forefront of citizens' minds, with defence and security seen as key campaign issues. At the national level, the EU's defence and security was mentioned first in nine countries. The economy, jobs, poverty and social exclusion, public health, climate change and the future of Europe are also featuring prominently as issues.\n\nWhat do EU lawmakers do?\n\nThe European Parliament is the only EU institution to be elected by European citizens. It's a real counterpower to the powerful EU's executive arm, the European Commission.\n\nThe parliament doesn't have the initiative of proposing legislation. But its powers are getting bigger. It is now competent on a wide range of topics, voting on laws relating to climate, banking rules, agriculture, fisheries, security or justice. The legislature also votes on the EU budget, which is crucial to the implementation of European policies, including, for instance, the aid delivered to Ukraine.\n\nLawmakers are also a key element of the check and balances system since they need to approve the nomination of all EU commissioners, who are the equivalent of ministers. And it can also force the whole commission to resign with a vote by a two-third majority.\n\nWhat is the current makeup of the Parliament?\n\nWith 176 seats out of 705 as of the end of the last plenary session in April, the center-right European People's Party is the largest political group in the European Parliament. Von der Leyen belongs to the EPP and hopes to remain at the helm of the EU's executive arm after the election.\n\nThe second-largest group is the S&D, the political group of the center-left Party of European Socialists, which currently holds 139 seats. The liberal and pro-European Renew group holds 102 seats ahead of an alliance made up of green and regionalist political parties that holds 72 seats.\n\nWhat can we expect from the results?\n\nTwo groups with far-right parties, the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and Identity and Democracy (ID), could be headed to becoming the third- and fourth-largest political groups at the European Parliament. The two groups have many divergences and it's unclear to what extent they could team up and affect the EU's agenda, especially the EU's efforts to support Ukraine against Russia in the war.\n\nThe EPP and S&D are expected to remain stable. Liberals and greens could both take a hit after they made big gains at the previous election.\n\nWhat will happen after the election?\n\nOnce the weight of each political force is determined, MEPs will elect their president at the first plenary session, from July 16-19. Then, most likely in September after weeks of negotiations, they will nominate the president of the European Commission, following a proposal made by the member states.\n\nIn 2019, von der Leyen won a narrow majority (383 votes in favor, 327 against, 22 abstentions) to become the first woman to head the institution. Parliamentarians will also hear from the European commissioners before approving them in a single vote.\n\nVon der Leyen has good chances to be appointed for another team, but she needs to secure the support of enough leaders. She has also antagonized many lawmakers by suggesting she could work with the hard right depending on the outcome of the elections.",

        "body": "At least 13 pro-Palestinian protesters were arrested at Stanford University early Wednesday morning after briefly barricading themselves in the president's office.\n\nThe demonstrators broke into Building 10, which houses the offices of the president and provost, at around 5:30 am, demanding that the California school divest from companies connected to Israel, and called for transparency and amnesty. A group of 50 protesters were outside the building chanting, \"Free, Free Palestine\".\n\nAround three hours after the protesters took over the building, they were cleared by campus police and the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office, according to Dee Mostofi, the university spokeswoman.\n\nShortly after the arrests, law enforcement officers started dismantling a pro-Palestinian encampment that had been on a campus plaza since late April, along with a nearby pro-Israel display.\n\nAll arrested students will be immediately suspended, and if any of them are seniors, they \"will not be allowed to graduate\", said school officials.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear whether \"will not be allowed to graduate\" indicated that students would be prohibited from participating in commencement ceremonies or expelled from the school without receiving their diplomas.\n\nThere was extensive damage to the interior of Building 10 and the exterior of the buildings in the main quad, Mostofi said.\n\nThe damage included \"extensive graffiti vandalism on the sandstone buildings and columns of the main quad\", she said in a statement, adding that it conveyed \"vile and hateful sentiments that we condemn in the strongest terms\".\n\nThe building had been renamed to \"D. Adnan's office\" in honor of Adnan al-Bursh, a Palestinian surgeon who died in April in an Israeli detention facility.\n\nThe protesters vowed to remain inside the building and refused to leave until their demands were met, according to the group's statement.\n\nThey wanted Stanford officials to include a vote by university trustees on whether to divest from companies \"that provide material and logistical support to Israel's current military campaign\".\n\nThey also demanded that the president of Stanford, Richard Saller, support the divestment proposal, disclose all holdings in Stanford's endowment and drop all disciplinary measures against pro-Palestinian student activists.\n\n\"If these demands are met, we will leave your office, President Saller,\" said an activist as she sat at a wooden desk inside the building, in a video posted on Instagram.\n\nOfficials said a public safety officer was injured after being shoved by protesters who interfered with a transport vehicle.\n\nIn April, 18 protesters were arrested at the university.\n\nWednesday was the last day of classes for the spring term. The upcoming graduation ceremony is set for June 15-16.\n\nCollege students across the nation staged campus protests this spring, demanding that their schools withdraw any investments they say are helping Israeli forces in their military operations in the Gaza Strip.\n\nDuring the current graduation season, several school commencement ceremonies were either canceled or relocated due to campus protests.\n\nNo school has agreed to divest financial connections to Israel. At Brown University in Rhode Island and at the New School in New York City, officials said they will discuss voting on the issue.",

Dozens of Palestinians were reported killed. The military said on Wednesday that the troops had begun an operation against \"terrorists and terrorist infrastructure above and below ground\" backed by air strikes, the BBC reported.\n\nAccording to residents, intense bombardment took place after the military operation began. The charity Médecins Sans Frontières claimed that at least 70 dead people, majority women and children, had been brought to a local hospital since Tuesday, the BBC reported.\n\nThis came at a time when US, Egyptian, and Qatari mediators met in Doha and Cairo to hold discussions on how to finalise a new ceasefire and hostage release deal.\n\nOn Tuesday, the US said it was still waiting for a response from Hamas to what it described as an Israeli proposal outlined by US President Joe Biden last week.\n\nAccording to the BBC, Qatar stated that it had delivered the plan to Hamas representatives and noted that it was also still waiting for a clear position from the Israeli government.\n\nHamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh said on Wednesday that the group would deal \"seriously and positively\" with a proposal based on an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.\n\nOne of the smallest refugee camps out of eight historic refugee camps in Gaza, Bureij covers an area of 0.5 sq km (0.2 sq miles) and had 46,000 residents registered with the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) before the war, as reported by the BBC.\n\nThe Buregi refugee camp is just to the south of the Wadi Gaza riverbed and the IDF's \"Central Gaza Strip Corridor.\" It is a section of land that is under the control of Israeli forces and runs east to west from the border with Israel to the Mediterranean Sea, dividing Gaza in two.\n\nAccording to the BBC, the Nuseirat and Maghazi refugee camps are also located near Bureij, while the town of Deir al-Balah is about 5 km (3 miles) to the south-west.\n\nEarlier this year, a ground operation against Hamas fighters was carried out by IDF troops in the camps of central Gaza that lasted several weeks.\n\nOn Wednesday, the IDF stated that the new \"targeted\" operation in Bureij and eastern Deir al-Balah was aimed at dismantling \"terrorist infrastructure located several kilometres away from the border with Israel above and below ground,\" as quoted by the BBC.\n\n\"The activity started with a series of aerial strikes on terror targets, including military compounds, weapons storage facilities, and underground infrastructure,\" the IDF's statement further stated.\n\nLater, the IDF put out a new statement announcing that troops had \"gained operational control\" of eastern Bureij and eastern Deir al-Balah. It added that they had \"eliminated terrorists\" in the areas, destroyed rocket and mortar launchers, and located several tunnel shafts.",

REUTERS\n\nUNICEF said on Thursday that nine out of 10 children in Gaza could not eat nutrients from enough food groups to ensure their healthy growth and development.\n\n\"In the Gaza Strip, months of hostilities and restrictions on humanitarian aid have collapsed the food and health systems, resulting in catastrophic consequences for children and their families,\" UNICEF said.\n\nIt said that five sets of data collected between December 2023 and April 2024 had found that 9 out of 10 children in the Gaza Strip, which has been pounded by an Israeli offensive since last October, are suffering from severe food poverty, meaning that they are surviving on two or fewer food groups per day.\n\n\"This is evidence of the horrific impact the conflict and restrictions are having on families' ability to meet children's food needs - and the speed at which it places children at risk of life-threatening malnutrition,\" UNICEF said.\n\nIsrael says it puts no limit on humanitarian supplies for civilians in Gaza and has blamed the United Nations for slow deliveries, saying its operations are inefficient.\n\nBut with pockets of famine emerging in Gaza, with some children dying from malnutrition and dehydration, even Israel's staunchest allies have increased pressure on it to do more to let in food.\n\nIn order to meet the minimum dietary diversity for healthy development, children must consume foods from at least five of the eight food groups defined by a dietary diversity score used by UNICEF and World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nThese include breastmilk, eggs, dairy products, and meat, poultry and fish, among other groups.\n\nUNICEF said that globally, 27% of children are living in severe child food poverty in early childhood, which amounts to 181 million children under the age of 5.\n\nIsrael's ground and air campaign was triggered when Hamas stormed southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing 253 more as hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nThe offensive has killed more than 36,500 people in Gaza, according to health authorities in the Hamas-run enclave.",

        "title": "Opinion: The only route to victory for Biden",
        "body": "Editor's Note: Liam Kerr co-founded WelcomePAC, which supports Democrats who persuade independent and GOP voters. He writes the WelcomeStack newsletter. The views expressed in this piece are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nThe biggest obstacle to President Joe Biden's reelection is not that polls show sharp declines in support among important Democratic demographic groups from 2020 to today. It's denying this reality.\n\nBiden's executive action Tuesday to limit asylum seekers at the border in spite of progressive opposition gives hope that he is taking the blinders off and course-correcting. But much more must be done and, as with most change, it's important to start by admitting there's a problem.\n\nThe phenomenon of Democrats dismissing the polls in favor of misplaced optimism has been termed \"hopium\" by data journalist Nate Silver. Its most prominent booster, Simon Rosenberg, has made this anti-polling case on CNN and in other major outlets. But it is not just Rosenberg who has injected this overly rosy perspective into the national narrative. Biden's closest advisers also reportedly buy into the thesis that polling is misleading.\n\nThis extends even to the president himself, who in early May said that, \"The polling data has been wrong all along. How many -- you guys do a poll at CNN. How many folks you have to call to get one response?\"\n\nBut there is no reason to think that polls comparing two extremely well-known presidential candidates would be systematically flawed in favor of Trump. Polling averages consistently showed Biden with a large lead in the 2020 Democratic primary, which he only briefly relinquished before going on to win the presidential nomination. In both 2016 and 2020, the polls were broadly accurate but, if anything, underestimated Trump's support.\n\nPolling denial is not unanimous in the party, as many Democrats are reportedly in a full-blown \"freakout\" over Biden's chances. But it's the Biden campaign decision-makers who matter. It's essential they admit the polling is correct, because if Biden is winning, there is little need to change course. But Biden is not winning.\n\nTrump has a persistent lead, particularly in swing states. CNN polling shows voters have reassessed their view of Trump since leaving office, with 55% now viewing his presidency as a success.\n\nThe good news for Biden is that Trump's lead is small, often within the margin of error, in the northern swing states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan that along with bluer states get him on the doorstep of the 270 electoral votes required to win. The better news is that the remedy for overcoming this persistent deficit matches the ailment: Appeal to moderates.\n\nThere are some initial signs Biden understands what needs to be done and is beginning to pivot despite his rosy view of the polls. Tuesday's border action echoes Trump on a major issue on which Biden has been mired deeply underwater. A Gallup poll in April found that, for the third month in a row, immigration was the top problem facing the country. Only 37% of Americans approved of his performance on the border while 61% disapproved.\n\nProgressives predictably expressed frustration with Biden's move on the border, but it would be a mistake for the Biden campaign to be swayed by these voices. Biden bested a wide field for his party's nomination in 2020 by building on a career in the political center and resisting his party's left flank. Since winning the nomination, however, Biden has embraced too many policies on the left.\n\nPolls now show that members of bedrock Democratic voting groups are abandoning Biden to align with Republicans, as CNN's Harry Enten has demonstrated. Understanding the lack of progressive appeal clarifies this dynamic: Young and minority voters are more moderate than often perceived, especially Black Democrats, who are typically more moderate than White Democrats. This means these groups likely share top concerns with moderate voters generally. Despite the headlines focused on college campuses, for instance, the Harvard Youth Poll found that when presented with 16 issues, young voters ranked two progressive favorites -- Gaza and student debt -- last.\n\nThe disaffected who voted for the president in 2020 but are not planning to in 2024 have been termed \"Biden Defectors.\" Overall, these defectors are eight times as likely to be moderate/conservative than to be very liberal. A New York Times/Siena survey found that Biden is losing 16% of 2020 voters who call themselves moderate and conservative to Trump, while losing only 2% who call themselves \"very liberal.\"\n\nHistorical trends back up the need for Biden to shift more toward the middle: Moderate candidates perform better. That's part of why candidates typically \"pivot to the center\" after winning party nominations. Notably, failed 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hilary Clinton eschewed such a pivot.\n\nBut running to the center is how Democrats flipped seats in 2022, engaging moderate Republicans and running to the center on issues. And it continued this year, with moderate Tom Suozzi flipping Rep. George Santos' vacated House seat to the D column in a New York special election in February.\n\nWhat does pivoting to the center look like over the next five months? For starters, Biden needs to continue to strike moderate positions. He should follow up his border action with overcoming his reluctance to talk about the country's record-breading energy production during his administration, for instance.\n\nHe also needs to reach out to center-right voters and their standard-bearers. Never-Trump Republicans were a group that proved crucial in 2022. While both Trump and Biden garnered 94% of their base (37% and 36% of the electorate respectively), according to exit polls, Biden won 6% of Republicans to Trump's 5% of Democrats, and a whopping 54% of independents to Trump's 41%.\n\nUnfortunately, there have been too many headlines about Biden not reaching out to Trump's Republican opponents, even those who have endorsed him. As NBC reported in December, \"For some Republicans who endorsed Biden in 2020, the next election looks bleak: Several who backed Biden said they never heard from him or his staff again.\"\n\nLastly, Biden needs to confront the extremists in his own party. He should do that by making more energetic public appearances and not displaying fear toward those who come in order to undermine him within his own party. The president needs to stop avoiding protests, which will be unavoidable at the Chicago Democratic National Convention anyway, and stand loudly and visibly on the side of the cops.\n\n\"Hopium\" may feel good. But as Biden noted last week during a commencement address, \"faith without works is dead.\" Democrats, and the country, should urge Biden to regain his faith in polling and his own ideological compass, and return to the path through the political center that won him the White House.",

        "body": "A former Meta (META.O), opens new tab engineer on Tuesday accused the company of bias in its handling of content related to the war in Gaza, claiming in a lawsuit that Meta fired him for trying to help fix bugs causing the suppression of Palestinian Instagram posts, APA reports citing Reuters.\n\nFerras Hamad, a Palestinian-American engineer who had been on Meta's machine learning team since 2021, sued the social media giant in a California state court for discrimination, wrongful termination and other wrongdoing over his February dismissal.\n\nIn the complaint, Hamad accused Meta of a pattern of bias against Palestinians, saying the company deleted internal employee communications that mentioned the deaths of their relatives in Gaza and conducted investigations into their use of the Palestinian flag emoji.\n\nThe company launched no such investigations for employees posting Israeli or Ukrainian flag emojis in similar contexts, according to the lawsuit.\n\nMeta spokesperson Andy Stone said Hamad was dismissed for violating the company's \"data access policies,\" which set limits on what employees can do with different types of data.\n\nHamad's claims reflect long-standing criticisms by human rights groups over Meta's performance moderating the content posted to its platforms about Israel and the Palestinian territories, including in an external investigation the company commissioned in 2021.\n\nConflict erupted in Gaza after Hamas militants attacked inside Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking over 250 people hostage according to Israeli tallies. Israel in response launched an offensive in Gaza that has killed more then 36,000 people, according to Gaza health officials, and triggered a humanitarian crisis.\n\nSince the outbreak of war last year, the company has faced accusations that it was suppressing expressions of support for Palestinians living amid the war.\n\nNearly 200 Meta employees raised similar concerns in an open letter to Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg and other leaders earlier this year.\n\nHamad said his firing appeared to stem from an incident in December involving an emergency procedure designed to troubleshoot severe problems with the company's platforms, known within Meta as a SEV or \"site event\".\n\nHe had noted procedural irregularities in the handling of an SEV related to restrictions on content posted by Palestinian Instagram personalities that prevented the posts from appearing in searches and feeds, the complaint said.\n\nIn one case, the complaint alleged, he found that a short video posted by Palestinian photojournalist Motaz Azaiza had been misclassified as pornographic even though it showed a destroyed building in Gaza.\n\nHamad said he received conflicting guidance from other employees about the status of the SEV and whether he was authorized to help resolve it, though he had worked on similarly sensitive SEVs before, including ones related to Israel, Gaza and Ukraine. His manager later confirmed in writing that the SEV was part of his job function, he said.\n\nThe next month, after a Meta representative told him he was the subject of an investigation, Hamad filed an internal discrimination complaint and days later was fired, he said.\n\nHamad said Meta told him he was fired for violating a policy barring employees from working on issues with accounts of people they know personally, referring to Azaiza, the photojouralist. Hamad said he had no personal connection to Azaiza.\n\nMeta declined to comment on what its data access policies specifically prohibit as well as Hamad's claims about the grounds for his firing.\n\nTikTok sues to block US law that could ban app Pro-Armenian senator from New Jersey Robert Menendez's corruption trial to get underway Biden to make his first state visit to France",

        "title": "MIL-OSI Australia: Minister Shorten interview on ABC Radio National with Patricia Karvelas",
        "body": "SUBJECTS: Eliminating fraud and overcharging in the NDIS; Getting The NDIS Back On Track bill; Service Australia speechwriter; violent protests at MP's offices\n\nPATRICIA KARVELAS, HOST: Major concerns about fraud within the National Disability Insurance Scheme have been put in the spotlight this week. Senate estimates hearings have heard cases of NDIS money being used for drugs, but it's still unclear just how deep the problems go. At the same time, the Government has introduced new legislation for the NDIS that would help to bring in more than $14 billion of savings over coming years. Bill Shorten is the Minister for the NDIS and Government Services and he is our guest. Minister, welcome.\n\nBILL SHORTEN, MINISTER FOR THE NDIS AND GIVERNMENT SERVICES: Good morning, Patricia.\n\nKARVELAS: We've known fraud has been an issue in the system, but we still don't know how widespread it is. Why don't we know yet the level of this fraud?\n\nSHORTEN: Because crooks don't self-report. That's why we don't know the full extent of it. But when I was the opposition spokesperson, I was critical of the last Government for not investing in the integrity of the back office of the Scheme, the payments integrity and scrutiny. But when I became Minister, I discovered the problem was far worse than I could have possibly imagined having. And so, I've put in place just absolutely heaps of stuff. And that's why we're talking about it today because we're seeing some of the results of the tens, hundreds of millions of dollars that we're investing.\n\nI set up a Fraud Fusion Task Force by about October of the first year that we were in power, and I got a very clever man, I sort of encouraged him to come and work at the NDIA from the ATO, Mr. John Dardo, the man who was giving the evidence and reporting on his findings. But it's $126 million task force that for the first time, 19 different Government agencies are comparing information so that we can track the crooks and the opportunists.\n\nKARVELAS: You've said you've created this fraud task force, and you have, right? You've increased resourcing to the commission. So, I think you thought it was about 5%. What is it, around 10%, the fraud. What do we know the figure to be?\n\nSHORTEN: I hear different guesstimates. The best data that I can get is that we've got 20 prosecutions in the courts and over 12 ready to, you know, hop off the runway, that we've got 510 compliance investigations from the Safeguards Commission, that we've got literally hundreds of investigations where we're proving up what's happening. So, it's unacceptable and it must run, and Mr. Dardo said that it must run into billions. I mean, the Scheme is now $42 billion. I think there's been naivety and negligence in terms of the management of the Scheme by some of the previous Government, when we were in opposition, we found that they had a couple of, only two investigation teams in the National Disability Insurance Agency and they weren't even fully staffed. We've been trying to draw attention to this matter, and now we're in Government, we're actually investing $300 million in better software.\n\nI'm going to tell you a story, which I think your listeners will, you know, practically drive off the road.\n\nSHORTEN: That when I said, Mr. Dardo said that it has an immature payment system, he's sort of been polite what we found and we've changed this now, is that for all the claims which come in daily, you know, invoices, only 20 were being checked, 20 or 21 a day, and in fact, between 5 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. on a given day, if you put in a claim, it was just paid. Like, there was zero checking of any claim between 5:00 pm and 6:30 p.m. because, you know, again, I guess no good deed goes unpunished. The previous Government just wanted to get money out to participants. But you've got to have some, you've got to have a 24-hour lag so you can check. We now check thousands of them a day.\n\nKARVELAS: Okay. So, there's a lot of work going into it, I appreciate that. Um, but you say billions could be rorted, billions. This isn't the first Government Scheme where we've invested a lot of money. Why has rorting in this particular Scheme been so bad?\n\nSHORTEN: Well, whether or not it's any worse than what was in the first ten years of Medicare, or when the colony of Victoria built train lines past politicians houses, you know, I think that ever since there's been Government money, there's been some people trying to take being opportunistic.\n\nKARVELAS: So, you think it's about the same as what the Medicare rorting was originally?\n\nSHORTEN: Listen, as I said at the start of this interview, you know exactly how much is being rorted as I said to you, quite seriously, crooks don't self-report. So, what we've got to do is not just do whack a mole, which is what we're doing. We've intensively increased resources at the Safeguards Commission and the NDIA while we try and catch people, detect them, increase the industrial level of our policing, so to speak.\n\nBut we've got to change the system so that structurally, people can't access the back door of the Scheme. That's where, you know, prevention is far better than detection. That's why getting the NDIA to be able to talk to the ATO, and we're going to put in laws to make sure that the smooth transfer of information can occur, the reason why that, for example, needs to be done is um, we found that a survey of 900 plan managers, these are people who manage people's plans, 350 or so of the companies had declared no income to the ATO, even though the NDIA had paid the money. So, this has happened in long day care. This has happened in childcare. It's happened in the vocational education area. I think there's, you know, problems with immigration, migration agents, some of them.\n\nOne of the things I've got to say, though, very quickly, is most service providers are doing the right thing, and absolutely most participants are doing the right thing. Some are vulnerable, may be getting manipulated. So, the problem whenever we talk about fraud is, on one hand, the sort of the right wing, you know, some of the far-right wing say, oh, you're not doing enough. It's almost like reporting the crime and catching the crooks, you get blamed for the crime. But then some perhaps, on the very sort of libertarian spectrum, say we shouldn't be talking about dodgy providers or if any participants doing the wrong thing, because somehow that's demonising them. The Scheme is changing hundreds of thousands of people's lives for the better. Most people are having a positive experience, but we but we've just got to clamp down on this, and that's what we've been doing since we got elected.\n\nKARVELAS: So, the opposition's spokesman, Michael Sukkar, says that Dardo's comments, Mr. Dardo's comments over the inability to prosecute all criminals rorting the system were alarming. He says that the Government has essentially waved the white flag on more criminal prosecutions, have you?\n\nSHORTEN: No, he would say that, wouldn't he? The only factor -\n\nKARVELAS: But still, is there substance to the level of activity? Does there need to be changes to the law? Why aren't more people getting prosecuted?\n\nSHORTEN: All right. Well, just to answer those five questions, the first thing is, with Michael Sukkar is, thank goodness I hired John Dardo and helped lure him across from the tax office, otherwise, Mr. Sukkar would have nothing to say. I mean, the very fact that we're talking about it, and we've set up a Fraud Fusion Task Force is because of one reason - Labor won the last election. You know, the F troop of former Ministers they had, they weren't interested. They just - they had a very small vision of the NDIS, which was a payment system, and just spray the money out into the environment and didn't worry where it landed. You know, that's why we're doing a whole lot of things about improving that we want to improve the quality of participant experiences, etc., but they paid no attention to this.\n\nHaving said that, we haven't waved the white flag. We've gone to war with the crooks. The reality is that our predecessors did two bits of bugger all, and that's the truth, you know. So, you know, great that Michael Sukkar says that, he's got a job to do.\n\nKARVELAS: But do you want to accelerate the prosecutions?\n\nSHORTEN: Yeah. That's why we've put in $300 million into our software, $126 million in our Fraud Fusion Task Force. That's why the Safeguards Commission is hiring its own barristers to take matters to court. Sure, I want every crook out of the Scheme. I loathe them. I think ripping off disabled people is just scum activity, and I can't stand them.\n\nKARVELAS: Given how alarming some of these headlines have been. Are you worried that that contract with the public and that trust in the NDIS is dramatically eroding now? Is that a big risk to the system and the NDIS future?\n\nSpeaker3: At one level, it breaks my heart when there's a negative story about the NDIS because I want it to be the best it can be. No, I think, you know, do I wish that sometimes the media would report the hundreds of thousands of good news stories? Sure. But let's face it, that's pretty boring, when there's good news, you know, John or Betty are just having a better life because of the NDIS isn't really front-page news.\n\nNo, I think what I want here is just the truth I learned at the Beaconsfield Mine rescue, a very important fact I've carried with me the rest of my life. You know, the mining company wanted us to pretend that the trapped miners were having a, you know, everything was blue sky. And some are reporting the disaster. Wanted to say the men were going to die every second. The truth was somewhere in between. And the truth with the NDIS is it's just changing lives. It's an investment. But the other truth is that it's a Government Scheme and it's been under-loved and understaffed and underfunded. And there are some crooks out there and I want them gone, and we'll do everything we can to stop them.\n\nKARVELAS: Okay. This bill, the getting the NDIS Back On Track bill, there's a clear issue. 87% of providers are not registered. And advocates say that's not addressed by this bill. Why isn't it?\n\nSHORTEN: Because we've got to keep consulting with people with disability. The funny thing is, some of the disability advocates saying that are people who say that we don't consult. I've created - the 12-month root and branch review said that we should have one system of registration. At the moment in Australia, about 15,000 service providers are registered and about 150,000 every quarter who put in invoices are unregistered. That's not sustainable. Some people worry, though, that if we require one system of registration for all providers, people with disability will lose their choice and control or their ability to self-manage. They won't. But I've got Natalie Wade, who's a leading human rights lawyer, and a task force of experts to do the work, in terms of how should we create a registration system which is not too clunky.\n\nBut the fact of the matter is, I say to people who don't want to have all providers in some form of registration, should we really be paying an invoice for someone who says they drove someone to the shops when we can't even ask for their driver's license, or whether or not they have car insurance, or if they're putting an invoice for working with kids, when we can't even know if they've got a working with kids check. So, look, the NDIS has been a remarkable experiment in the unregistered world of just laissez faire. Just pay the money and don't worry about who or what's doing anything. That's not sustainable. There's a lot of great unregistered providers, don't get me wrong. But we can't have this system where some people have a driver's license to go on the road and others drive and don't have to have a driver's license.\n\nKARVELAS: Minister, I must ask you, and I must for lots of reasons, but there are literally hundreds of text messages about this issue. Of course, there's been this controversy over the $600,000 contract for a speechwriter in your department. You've said that you had nothing to do with it, accepting that. Did your department make the wrong decision?\n\nSHORTEN: Well, first of all, this speechwriter is the only person in Australia who gets their two years contract bundled up as if it's a one-year contract. It's not 600,000.\n\nKARVELAS: That's still a lot of money compared to the people who are texting in saying, you know, cost of living crisis.\n\nSHORTEN: That's the first thing. You're a seasoned journalist. So, when we use a two-year salary for this woman, we don't do that for anyone else. Julianne Stewart has been a professional writer for more than 40 years. She's written speeches for Ministers, Attorney Generals, for Prime Ministers, ASX 200 CEOs, Vice Chancellors, and commercial television. She ran a team of writers in Prime Minister and Cabinet under Prime Ministers Abbott and Turnbull, of five speechwriters and a full-time letter writer.\n\nWhat happened when I became the Minister is in a department of 5000 people, the one speechwriter that always had, had died. So, they advertised to employ someone. They didn't get anyone they thought was good enough, so they had to go to market and let a contract. Of course, I have nothing to do with any of that, but I'm advised her remuneration is equivalent to the lower end of a senior public servant, specialist speechwriting communication experts are rare, her experience and seniority -\n\nKARVELAS: Okay, does that mean there are lots of others who are paid like this? If she's at the lower end.\n\nSHORTEN: What it means is in the public service, there is APS ranked staff and they have certain grades, and they get paid up, under awards, to certain grades. Then you have EL2 rankings and then you have three bands of SES. She's at the lower band, SES Band 1, of that level. Like, the public service of 100,000 plus people has these gradations. She's a very experienced woman of over 40 years, does a great job -\n\nKARVELAS: So, you think it was the right call?\n\nSHORTEN: Well, I'm just thinking that, you know, when I became the Minister for Services Australia, we were spending $1.3 billion on contractors. We now spent half a billion. When I became Minister, 70% of the staff of Services Australia were direct employees, 30% were contractors. It's now 85% direct, 15% contractors. But what amazes me is some Senator who thinks that some public servant contractor is paid more than them, and then they turn on the outrage factory. I didn't negotiate a wage. She's a lovely, experienced person, and she turns out hundreds of products of work, not just for me, but she mentors staff. She's run training courses. And do you know, a little bit of irony. And radio national this morning, she's received more job offers and more pay rise offers on LinkedIn since this came out. But anyway, let's never let the truth get in the way of a good clickbait.\n\nKARVELAS: And how can I not? And there's clearly public interest in this Minister, because I'm telling you, it's coming in thick and fast.\n\nSHORTEN: I believe that, but no one has heard what I just said till you gave me the chance to say it. So, thank you.\n\nKARVELAS: I'm glad we've got to speak. I love speaking, you know that. I love talking to you. Just finally, let's talk about yesterday. Let's talk about the parliament, the Government, and the opposition joining forces to condemn Greens members involvement in pro-Palestinian protests, accusing the party of inflaming tensions of social cohesion. Did that action not also inflame tensions?\n\nSHORTEN: So, we can't tell the truth anymore? The reality is that Greens members have attended aggressive demonstrations outside MPs offices. Like, people have got a right to protest. People have got a right to feel incredibly strongly about the tragedy in Gaza. People have got a right to talk about anti-Semitism. Like, this is just diabolical. Dreadful. The sooner that Israel can get out of Gaza, just the best for everyone, I get that.\n\nBut, what we're seeing, though, is the use of - and it's only a minority. Do I think every Green member does it? No, but there is a minority of people inciting aggro here, bringing the arguments, and it means that when staff working in electorate offices are jostled, where there's windows broken. I mean, this is intimidation of the democratic process.\n\nKARVELAS: In Question Time, Peter Dutton equated protesters, well, some of them at least, with Holocaust deniers. Have you seen that?\n\nSHORTEN: No, but I don't tend to go to the protests. Listen, Mr. Dutton can explain his words. Our Prime Minister was very clear and very forthright. And really, there are red lines in protests. You may believe in your cause, but that doesn't give you the right to break the law. The other thing is, no one's cause, makes them so morally superior that the rest of the laws don't apply to them. And furthermore, I mean, heaven forbid one would be pragmatic in how you persuade the majority, but yelling and screaming at people, being aggressive is counterproductive to peace, isn't it?\n\nKARVELAS: Bill Shorten, always great to speak to you. Thanks for coming on the show.\n\nSHORTEN: Fantastic, bye.\n\nKARVELAS: Bye. Minister for the NDIS and Government Services, Bill Shorten.",

We did not go into great detail about what it was.\"\n\nFor months, negotiators from the US, Egypt and Qatar have been trying to mediate an end to the conflict that has killed tens of thousands, but a deal has proven elusive.\n\nThe proposal announced Friday calls for an initial six-week ceasefire with an Israeli military withdrawal from populated areas of Gaza and the release of some hostages while \"a permanent end to hostilities\" is negotiated through mediators.\n\n[[nid:688487]]\n\nIt seeks to build on a deal Hamas accepted earlier this year by keeping a ceasefire in place as negotiations continue, with the aim of reaching a permanent cessation of hostilities, a long-standing Hamas demand.\n\nBiden's announcement and his framing of the proposal as a deal \"Israel has offered,\" was intended to raise hopes for a ceasefire and put pressure on Netanyahu, said Jeremi Suri, a history and public affairs professor at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\n\"Biden is trying to box Netanyahu into accepting the proposal,\" said Suri.\n\nAsked whether the Biden's announcement was an attempt to put pressure on Netanyahu, an Israeli official said that nobody can prevent Israel from destroying Hamas and its governing capabilities.\n\n\"The notion that pressure will cause Israel to act in contrast to its national interest is silly,\" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"The pressure should be put on Hamas.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Monday, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby denied that the administration was trying to \"jam\" the Israeli leader.\n\nIt is not clear the latest ceasefire proposal will succeed.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters that mediators were still awaiting a Hamas response.\n\nAnd although Ophir Falk, Netanyahu's foreign policy adviser, said soon after Friday's announcement that Netanyahu had signed off on the proposal, the Israeli leader later made public comments raising doubts that he fully supports it.\n\n[[nid:688483]]\n\nOn Wednesday, far-right minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said his party would \"disrupt\" the ruling coalition until Netanyahu discloses details of the prospective Gaza deal.\n\nFor his part, Biden faces pressure to end the fighting in Gaza. His Democratic party has been divided over his support for Israel's assault on the enclave, with voters in key battleground states threatening not to support him in November's rematch with Republican candidate Donald Trump.\n\nThe war began on Oct 7 when Hamas-led Palestinian fighters killed more than 1,200 people in Israel, mostly civilians, and seized more than 250 as hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nThe Israeli military campaign that followed has left Gaza in ruins and killed more than 36,000 people, according to Palestinian health authorities.\n\nDespite the obstacles, US officials say that by publicly airing the Israeli proposal, Biden can kick-start renewed discussions.\n\n\"(Biden) thought it was important to lay out the details publicly so that the whole world can see what was in here and the whole world could see how seriously Israel was taking this, and to make it clear that Hamas absolutely needs to accept this proposal,\" said one of the officials.\n\nIn doing so, Biden employed a tactic he has used previously in his decades as a politician: making a public announcement about a deal in hopes of moving the parties forward, said historian Thomas Alan Schwartz of Vanderbilt University.\n\n\"By saying Israel had agreed he was putting Israel in a tough position to say no. In that sense he may have been trying to influence domestic policies in Israel,\" Schwartz said.",

        "title": "'National disgrace': ABC under fire for criticising Sky News' coverage of antisemitism in Australia",
        "body": "Shadow home affairs minister James Paterson and a prominent Australian Jewish leader have strongly rebuked the ABC for having chided Sky News Australia for its frequent coverage of the rise of antisemitism across the nation.\n\nIn late May, ABC host Paul Barry jibed Sky News host Chris Kenny for discussing the crisis with Robert Kennedy from the Australian Jewish Association.\n\n\"On our count it's around the 30th time discussed on Kenny's show since the war began,\" Barry said.\n\nEarlier in May, former ABC director Joe Gersh spoke to Sky News host Sharri Markson and said he was concerned it was left to Sky News and former treasurer Josh Frydenberg to cover and televise the mounting antisemitism in Australia, a \"crisis\" the national broadcaster had not \"fully understood\".\n\n\"It is a matter of deep concern to me, as a member of the Jewish community, as a former ABC director, and as an Australian citizen, that our national broadcaster has not fully understood and dealt with, what I believe, has reached crisis proportion which is antisemitism in this country,\" Mr Gersh said.\n\nSpeaking to Markson, who is Jewish and has extensively covered the crisis on her program, Mr Paterson and Israel and Jewish Affairs Council Executive Director Colin Rubenstein examined the ABC's apparent jibe which downplayed the extent of the anti-Jewish sentiment gripping the nation.\n\n\"I thought it was a very bold call by Paul Barry and the ABC to attack Sky News for being too focussed and too concerned about antisemitism,\" Mr Paterson said.\n\nSenator Paterson said it had become an \"unprecedented crisis\" in Australia and over the last eight months Jewish entities such as the Executive Council of Australian Jewry had tracked a 700 per cent increase in antisemitism.\n\n\"When Victoria Police report that massive increases in antisemitic incidents ten times the frequency of anti-Islamic incidents, I think we should all be concerned about that,\" he said.\n\n\"We should all be focussed on it. But the ABC has shown a lack of curiosity, a lack of interest and a lack of concern about this issue.\"\n\nMr Paterson said it was a \"national disgrace\" the ABC had not focused on the \"mainstream\" sentiment of the Jewish community and instead produced a documentary on Jewish anti-Zionist activist and journalist Antony Loewenstein.\n\n\"When we have Holocaust survivors say they've never felt less safe in their own country, in Australia, that's a national disgrace. And the fact that a national broadcaster is so uninterested in that is a great shame,\" he said.\n\nMr Rubenstein said Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's \"history\" on his support for Palestinians was \"no secret\", and although he accepted the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of antisemitism, he did not understand the \"realities of the situation of the last two decades\".\n\nSenator Paterson said the Prime Minister had a \"deep-seated sympathy\" for the Palestinian cause which went \"far beyond a genuine humanitarian sympathy\" and into an anti-Israel \"bias and hatred\".\n\n\"Over a long period of time, some of his statements in the House of Representatives have been filled with bile, have been shockingly biased against Israel, have been totally unbalanced, and I think that has really impacted his ability to stand strong as Prime Minister against a moral crisis in our own country of antisemitism,\" Mr Paterson said.\n\nOn the point of Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong's refusal to rule out supporting a Palestinian state, even if Hamas continued to play a role in governance in Gaza, Mr Rubenstein said it showed a \"lack of moral clarity\" and a \"complete contradiction\" of the government's position.\n\nMr Rubenstein said on one hand Labor accepted the \"abhorrent\" terrorism committed by Hamas against Israel, as Mr Albanese had recognised on Wednesday, but on the other had they had voted in favour of Palestinian recognition in the UN resolution a few weeks ago.\n\n\"It represents a complete contradiction that Hamas will continue to be governing in Gaza and calling for a permanent cease fire. So, there's a lack of moral clarity, and there's a lack of recognition of what the facts are,\" Mr Rubenstein said.\n\nHe said early recognition of Palestinians \"might increase\" the possibility of moving towards reconciliation, but the \"tragedy\" of the situation was it \"reinforces\" and \"rewards\" terrorism.",

        "title": "Gov. Shapiro, Pitt chancellor give vastly different takes on pro-Palestinian encampment than protest's leaders",
        "body": "Gov. Josh Shapiro's office late Wednesday called it \"unfortunate\" that a 30-hour pro-Palestinian encampment at the University of Pittsburgh \"devolved into documented violence, vandalism, and antisemitic rhetoric.\"\n\nThe statement from Shapiro press secretary Manuel Bonder came hours after Pitt Divest from Apartheid, the group that organized the encampment, offered a far different assessment during a news conference at Flagstaff Hill that was posted on Instagram.\n\nSpeakers claimed that state police, at the behest of Pitt Chancellor Joan Gabel, were poised to forcibly clear what had been a peaceful encampment early Tuesday, leaving protesters little choice but to leave the Cathedral of Learning lawn.\n\nThey said Gabel and Pitt leadership refused to meet with students and other protesters and embraced what the group called brutal police tactics that left some bloodied in scuffles outside the iconic 42-story classroom tower.\n\nNeither the governor's office nor Pitt directly addressed whether the university or its chancellor asked for state police intervention. But the governor called the group's assertions false and inflammatory.\n\n\"Pennsylvania State Police was in close contact with city, university, and county law enforcement monitoring the situation and standing ready to assist if requested by local authorities -- as is standard practice,\" it read.\n\n\"Here in Pennsylvania, we stand against hate -- and the Shapiro Administration will not tolerate the proliferation of antisemitism or hate in any form. It is unfortunate that this encampment devolved into documented violence, vandalism, and antisemitic rhetoric -- but we believe its quick ending was the appropriate outcome.\"\n\nAs have protesters on other campuses nationally this spring, those at Pitt decried civilian deaths in Gaza, calling it Israeli genocide. They demand that Pitt divest from holdings and institutions in Israel that support Israel's war against Hamas.\n\nGabel, in a message to campus Monday, called into question exactly who the protest leaders were. She said \"self-proclaimed\" leaders who emerged demanding to meet with Pitt leadership were not, in fact, students or otherwise affiliated with the university.\n\nAt Wednesday's news conference, speakers wearing masks challenged Pitt to back up that assertion. The attendees included some of the same community representatives who went to Pitt on Monday to express support for the encampment.\n\nKarim Alshurafa, who described himself informally as a spokesperson for Palestinians in Pittsburgh, part of the Pittsburgh Palestine Coalition, said Pitt has chosen an incorrect path.\n\n\"The violent response from the university will not be forgotten. We ask the chancellor to reconsider the way she is handling the situation,\" he said.\" Suppressing the voices of her students can only lead to worse actions and potentially people getting hurt.\"\n\nOthers offered accounts from anonymous protesters describing injuries they say they sustained in scuffles with Pitt police outside the building. On Monday, some of the same speakers stood outside the Cathedral and said Gabel ought to meet with protesters.\n\nInstead, Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey joined Allegheny County Executive Sara Innamorato in conversations that lead to protesters decision to peacefully leave the encampment early Tuesday\n\nThe crowd at one point Monday evening surged above 300. Toppled railings left on the lawn were evidence of the confrontations outside the building.\n\nOrganizers denied there was any vandalism by the group.\n\nTo that, Pitt spokesman Jared Stonesifer responded:\n\n\"The exterior of the Frick Fine Arts Building was defaced with graffiti and a weapon was thrown through a window. A total of four windows were broken at the building and graffiti was also observed on a University sign at the intersection of Fifth and Bellefield avenues adjacent to the Cathedral of Learning lawn.\"\n\nGabel said in her campuswide message that Pitt is more committed than ever to promoting free expression.\n\n\"However, we have no illusions that the efforts of this group last night are directed toward free expression. They are markedly different from the largely peaceful protest in Schenley Plaza in April.\"\n\nSupporters of the encampment had little sympathy for leadership of a taxpayer-supported university that chose not to meet directly with students and others.\n\nMizanoor Biswas, a member of the Islamic Center whose son graduated from Pitt, said Monday that Pitt has an obligation to listen to the demonstrators who encamped.\n\n\"Whether they agree or disagree doesn't matter,\" Biswas said. \"This is what we get as a consumer of this university?\"",

        "body": "The Ministry of Health in Gaza said that the Israeli occupation forces committed a new massacre tonight by targeting Al-Sardi School, which shelters displaced people in Nuseirat refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip.\n\nIsmail al-Thawabta, director of the government media office in Gaza, said in a press conference that the number of people killed is expected to rise due to the large number of serious and critical injuries.\n\nThe Israeli army admitted to carrying out the attack, claiming that its warplanes bombed a compound used by Hamas inside a school belonging to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) in Nuseirat refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip.\n\nInitial media reports, including those by Al-Jazeera said that at least 29 Palestinians were killed as a result of the Israeli shelling that targeted the school housing displaced people in Camp 2 in Nuseirat.\n\nAttacks on Central Gaza\n\nOn Wednesday, the Israeli occupation forces continued their raids on several areas in the Gaza Strip, leaving dozens of dead and wounded, and causing massive destruction in the health sector.\n\nHours before the Nuseirat school massacre, Israel attacked Maghazi refugee camp, also in central Gaza, killing and wounded many.\n\nMédecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said at least 70 were killed and more than 300 wounded had been taken to Al-Aqsa hospital since Tuesday as a result of Israeli airstrikes on central Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli occupation also launched a series of raids targeting the eastern areas of Deir al-Balah.\n\nMeanwhile, four Palestinians were killed in an Israeli raid on a gathering of citizens in the Rimal neighborhood in central Gaza City.\n\nThroughout the last 24 hours, Israeli artillery shelled Nuseirat, Al-Mughraqa, Al-Zahra and Al-Bureij refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip.\n\nAl-Jazeera correspondent reported that the number of Palestinians killed rose to 97 people within 24 hours, as a result of the Israeli shelling.\n\nWar Crimes\n\nCurrently on trial before the International Court of Justice for genocide against Palestinians, Israel has been waging a devastating war on Gaza since October 7.\n\nAccording to Gaza's Ministry of Health, 36,586 Palestinians have been killed, and 83,074 wounded in Israel's ongoing genocide in Gaza starting on October 7.\n\nMoreover, at least 11,000 people are unaccounted for, presumed dead under the rubble of their homes throughout the Strip.\n\nPalestinian and international organizations say that the majority of those killed and wounded are women and children.\n\nThe Israeli war has resulted in an acute famine, mostly in northern Gaza, resulting in the death of many Palestinians, mostly children.\n\nThe Israeli aggression has also resulted in the forceful displacement of nearly two million people from all over the Gaza Strip, with the vast majority of the displaced forced into the densely crowded southern city of Rafah near the border with Egypt - in what has become Palestine's largest mass exodus since the 1948 Nakba.\n\nIsrael says that 1,200 soldiers and civilians were killed during the Al-Aqsa Flood Operation on October 7. Israeli media published reports suggesting that many Israelis were killed on that day by 'friendly fire'.\n\nGAZA LIVE BLOG: Massacre in Nuseirat | Israel Bombs UNRWA School | Lebanon Front Escalates | Putin: 'Complete Destruction' - Day 243",

        "title": "Hamas signals post-war ambition in talks with Palestinian rival Fatah",
        "body": "RAMALLAH - Deep divisions will limit progress at reconciliation talks between Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah this month, conversations with five sources in the groups indicate, but the meetings highlight that the Islamist group is likely to retain influence after Israel's conflict in Gaza.\n\nThe talks between Hamas and the Fatah party of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will be held in China in mid-June, according to officials from both sides. They follow two recent rounds of reconciliation talks, one in China and one in Russia. China's Foreign Ministry declined to comment.\n\nThe next meeting will be held amid attempts by international mediators to reach a ceasefire deal for Gaza, with one of the key sticking points being the \"day-after\" plan - how the enclave will be governed.\n\nEven as it is pummelled militarily, the meetings of Hamas politicians with officials from the Fatah party that controls Palestinian politics in the Israeli-occupied West Bank point to the group's aim of shaping the post-conflict order in the Palestinian territories, according to a source familiar with conversations within Hamas\n\nConsidered a terrorist organization by many Western nations, Hamas was shunned long before its Oct 7 attacks killed 1,200 people in Israel, with more than 250 hostages taken, triggering the conflict in Gaza.\n\nBut even as it is pummelled militarily, the meetings of Hamas politicians with officials from the Fatah party that controls Palestinian politics in the Israeli-occupied West Bank point to the group's aim of shaping the post-conflict order in the Palestinian territories, according to a source familiar with conversations within Hamas.\n\nThe person, like other unnamed officials in this story, declined to be named because they weren't authorized to discuss sensitive matters with the media.\n\nHamas, which ruled Gaza before the conflict, recognizes it cannot be part of any internationally recognized new government of the Palestinian territories when fighting in the enclave eventually ends, said the source.\n\nALSO READ: Hamas wants Israel to commit to permanent ceasefire, full withdrawal from Gaza\n\nNonetheless, it wants Fatah to agree to a new technocratic administration for the West Bank and Gaza as part of a wider political deal, the source and senior Hamas official Basim Naim said.\n\n\"We are speaking about political partnership and political unity to restructure the Palestinian entity,\" Naim, who attended the previous round of China talks, said in an interview.\n\n\"Whether Hamas is in the government or outside it, that is not a prime demand of the movement and it doesn't see it a condition for any reconciliation,\" he said. Naim, like much of Hamas' political leadership, operates in exile outside of Gaza.\n\nThe prospect of Hamas surviving as an influential political player is a thorny issue for Western states.\n\nDespite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Gaza conflict goal of destroying the Iran-backed group, most observers agree Hamas will exist in some form after a ceasefire. An offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, the movement has deep reach and ideological roots in Palestinian society.\n\nThe United States and EU oppose any role for Hamas in governing Gaza after the conflict, during which Israel's offensive has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to the Gazan health ministry.\n\nStill, some US officials have privately expressed doubt Israel will eradicate the group. A senior US official said on May 14 Washington thought it unlikely Israel could achieve \"total victory\".\n\nKilling every member of Hamas was unrealistic and was not the goal of the Israeli army, but destroying Hamas as a governing authority was \"an achievable and attainable military objective,\" said Peter Lerner, a spokesperson for Israel's military.\n\nALSO READ: Israel assessing alternatives to Hamas rule in Gaza, defense minister says\n\nLow odds\n\nWestern states support the idea of post-conflict Gaza being run by a revamped Palestinian Authority (PA), the administration led by Abbas that has limited self-rule over patches of the West Bank. Based in Ramallah, the PA is broadly acknowledged globally as representing the Palestinians and receives security assistance from the United States and the EU.\n\nDespite the talks, the factions' enmity means odds remain low for a deal to reunite the administration of the Palestinian territories, the conversations with the five sources indicated, a view echoed by four experts\n\nLed by Abbas, and before him Yasser Arafat, Fatah was the undisputed leader of the Palestinian cause for decades until the rise of Hamas, an Islamist movement.\n\nThe PA also ran Gaza until 2007, when Hamas drove Fatah from the enclave, a year after defeating Fatah in parliamentary elections - the last time Palestinians voted.\n\nDespite the talks, the factions' enmity means odds remain low for a deal to reunite the administration of the Palestinian territories, the conversations with the five sources indicated, a view echoed by four experts.\n\n\"My expectations of rapprochement are minimal or less,\" said Yezid Sayigh, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center.\n\nPalestinians aspire to a state on all territory occupied by Israel in the 1967 war, when Israel seized the West Bank - including East Jerusalem - and the Gaza Strip.\n\nDespite 143 countries recognizing Palestine, including Ireland, Spain and Norway last week, hopes for a sovereign nation have been diminishing for years as Israel expands settlements in the West Bank and opposes statehood.\n\nALSO READ: Spain, Ireland and Norway recognize Palestinian statehood\n\nThe Hamas-Fatah split further complicates the goal. The factions hold deeply diverging views about strategy, with Fatah committed to negotiations with Israel to bring about an independent nation while Hamas backs armed struggle and does not recognize Israel.\n\nThe Hamas-Fatah split further complicates the goal. The factions hold deeply diverging views about strategy, with Fatah committed to negotiations with Israel to bring about an independent nation while Hamas backs armed struggle and does not recognize Israel\n\nThe bitterness spilled into the open at an Arab summit in May, when Abbas accused Hamas of giving Israel \"more pretexts\" to destroy Gaza by launching the Oct 7 attack.\n\nHamas said the remark was regrettable, calling Oct 7 a crucial moment in the Palestinian struggle.\n\nHamas' 1988 founding charter called for Israel's destruction. In 2017, Hamas said it agreed to a transitional Palestinian state within frontiers pre-dating the 1967 war, though it still opposed recognizing Israel's right to exist.\n\nHamas has restated this position since the eruption of the Gaza conflict.\n\nNew government?\n\nIn March, Abbas swore in a new PA cabinet headed by Mohammed Mustafa, a close Abbas aide who oversaw Gaza reconstruction during a previous stint in government from 2013 to 2014. Though the cabinet is made up of technocrats, Abbas' move angered Hamas, which accused him of acting unilaterally.\n\nSenior Fatah official Sabri Saidam told Reuters that forming a new government would amount to wasting time.\n\nA second senior official familiar with Fatah's terms for the China talks said it wants Hamas to acknowledge the role of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) as the Palestinians' sole legitimate representative, and to commit to the agreements the PLO has signed.\n\nThis would include the Oslo accords signed 30 years ago under which the PLO recognized Israel and which Hamas violently opposed.\n\nThe official said Fatah would want the government to have full security and administrative control in Gaza - a challenge to Hamas' sway there.\n\nFundamentally at odds with the PLO over Israel, Hamas has never joined the body but has long called for elections to its governing institutions, including its legislative body known as the PNC.\n\nALSO READ: Israeli forces kill dozens of Palestinians in Gaza strikes, battle Hamas in Rafah\n\nHamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh said on Friday that in addition to a government of \"national consensus\", the group wants elections for the PA presidency, parliament and the PNC.\n\nGhassan Khatib, a lecturer at Birzeit University in the West Bank, said Hamas was interested in reconciliation only on its terms, maintaining its politics, security apparatus and ideology, which he said would risk plunging the PLO into international isolation.\n\n\"Abbas cannot accept them with their politics, because that would jeopardize the only PLO achievement - international recognition,\" he said.\n\nPart of the fabric\n\nSenior Fatah official Sabri Saidam said consensus was necessary to manage aid and reconstruction in Gaza. Fatah had made clear it would not return to Gaza \"on the back of an (Israeli) tank, but rather we will come in agreement with everyone\", he added\n\nDespite this, Fatah official Tayseer Nasrallah said Fatah viewed Hamas as part of \"the Palestinian national fabric and part of the political fabric also\".\n\nSaidam said consensus was necessary to manage aid and reconstruction in Gaza. Fatah had made clear it would not return to Gaza \"on the back of an (Israeli) tank, but rather we will come in agreement with everyone\", he added.\n\nIsraeli government spokesperson Tal Heinrich said the PA's willingness to work with Hamas was \"unfortunate\".\n\nAn opinion poll conducted in the West Bank and Gaza by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research in March showed Hamas enjoying more support than Fatah, with its popularity still higher than before the conflict.\n\nBeing hosted by China has marked a diplomatic boost for the Iran-backed Hamas.\n\nAshraf Abouelhoul, managing editor of the Egyptian state-owned paper Al-Ahram and a specialist on Palestinian affairs, said Hamas was more interested in a deal than Fatah, because reconciliation could give the battle-weary organization cover to rebuild.\n\nREAD MORE: UN Mideast envoy calls for resumption of Israel-Hamas talks\n\nMohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center said it was difficult to imagine Hamas embarking on any military action that would prompt large-scale Israeli retaliation in the foreseeable future.\n\nBut, he said, reconciliation would be a \"transitional phase that would allow Hamas to slowly rearm\".",

However, normalisation attempts were scuttled following the toppling of President Mohamed Nasheed in February 2012.\n\nOpposition parties and government allies in the Maldives have been putting pressure on Muizzu to ban Israelis, as a sign of protest against the Gaza attack.\n\nOfficial data showed the number of Israelis visiting the Maldives dropped to 528 in the first four months of this year, down 88 per cent compared to the corresponding period last year.\n\nIn response to the ban, a spokesman for the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged citizens to avoid travel to the Maldives. -- AFP",

        "title": "Amid China's peace drive, Biden unveils Gaza ceasefire plan - Pakistan Observer",
        "body": "LAST week, Beijing called for an international peace conference to end the Israel-Hamas war following talks with Arab heads of State in Chinese capital-Beijing. President Xi reiterated Chinese support -for a two-state solution that would see the establishment of a formal Palestinian State -- manifests China's growing efforts to engage in Middle Eastern diplomacy. Addressing Arab leaders at the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum in Beijing, Xi said Israel's war on Gaza \"should not continue indefinitely\" and \"justice should not be absent forever\". Amid this Chinese peace initiative, US President Biden announced Gaza-ceasefire proposal.\n\nChina's peace diplomacy: It goes without saying that China has an emerging role towards global peace and prosperity. Contextually, China's proactive engagement is evidenced by its multifaceted diplomatic initiatives, including its twelve-point peace proposal for the Russia-Ukraine conflict and its instrumental role in facilitating the restoration of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\nIn a positive development, Chinese and Arab-nation ministers adopted a strident joint statement condemning Israel's \"aggression against the Palestinian people\" and in Rafah, according to the document as published by Chinese state media last Friday.: In Thursday's joint statement, China and its Arab-nation counterparts also called for the \"end of the occupation of the territory of the State of Palestine\" and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state\n\nNeedless to say, China has repeatedly called for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as well as an immediate ceasefire and Palestinian membership in the UN - positions which align closely with those of Arab nations. Beijing is increasingly flexing its diplomatic influence in the region, hosting the first talks on Chinese soil between feuding Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah in April. Meanwhile, the ongoing strife between Israel and Palestine continues to exact a heavy toll on civilian lives, particularly in the besieged enclave of Gaza. With over 36,000 fatalities and tens of thousands injured, the conflict has inflicted immeasurable suffering on the population, representing a significant loss of life in proportion to Gaza's pre-war population.\n\nBiden peace plan: \"Everyone who wants peace now must raise their voices and work to make it real. It's time for this war to end,\" US President Biden said during a surprise address at the White House on Friday. Biden said that Israel had proposed a deal involving an initial six-week ceasefire with a partial Israeli military withdrawal and the release of some hostages while \"a permanent end to hostilities\" is negotiated through mediators, thereby arguing that previously the deal talks- initiated by the US, Egypt and Qatar -- seeking for months to mediate an end to the war -- remained elusive. The Biden ceasefire plan consists of three phases.\n\nAccordingly, phase one involves an exchange of wounded, elderly and female hostages for Palestinian detainees during a six-week ceasefire, the same basic plan that collapsed at talks in Cairo just under a month ago after months of haggling. Biden plan's first phase would start with six weeks of a full and complete cease-fire, including the withdrawal of Israeli forces from populated areas of Gaza, and the release of women and children being held hostage, Biden said during the surprise announcement. This initial stage would also include a surge of humanitarian assistance, with 600 trucks carrying aid into Gaza every day.\n\nThe second phase will involve the complete Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, lasting another six weeks. In return, Hamas will release \"all remaining living hostages\". This includes male Israeli soldiers. Providing both sides stick to the terms of the agreement, this will lead the \"cessation of hostilities permanently,\" according to Biden quoting the Israeli proposal. Phase 3 entails- a reconstruction and stabilization plan for Gaza, supported by the US and international community-centering on the rebuilding of residential areas, schools and hospitals. President Biden also ensures that the US would work with regional partners to ensure it happens in a way that \"does not allow Hamas to rearm.\"This phase will last 3-5 years.\n\nResponse of the global powers: Leaders of the G-7 nations on Monday said they \"fully endorse\" a proposal recently outlined by US President Joe Biden to end the fighting in the Gaza Strip that would lead to an immediate cease-fire. \"We reaffirm our support for a credible pathway towards peace leading to a two State solution,\" the G7 leaders said in a joint statement on the agreement, which it said also includes \"the release of all hostages, a significant and sustained increase in humanitarian assistance for distribution throughout Gaza, and an enduring end to the crisis, with Israel's security interests and Gazan civilian safety assured.\"\n\nNotably, the EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and the EU Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrel have backed Biden's ceasefire plan. Moreover, now Washington wants that the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) must adopt a resolution backing the proposal - urging both sides, Israel and Hamas - to end fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\nMeanwhile, Dennis Ross, the former U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, said on MSNBC that Netanyahu and his entire War Cabinet had accepted the cease-fire proposal Biden prescribed. The said proposal seems balanced and realistic as it covers the interests of all the stakeholders of the conflict. Despite Israeli tacit consent of the Biden's revealed proposal, apparently some officials of the Israeli government, including Israeli premier Netanyahu and his defense minister Gallant are trying to show indifference over this proposal whereas the truth posits that without Israeli approval, the said proposal would have ceased to exist.\n\nIt goes without saying that the pressure is mounting on both the US and Israeli Administrations to end the war in the Gaza Strip. This growing moral and legal pressure has been galvanized by the rising voices in the global civil society, including the human rights activists, the academics, diplomats and the jurists.\n\n-- The writer, an independent 'IR' researcher-cum-international law analyst based in Pakistan, is member of European Consortium for Political Research Standing Group on IR, Critical Peace & Conflict Studies, also a member of Washington Foreign Law Society and European Society of International Law.

        "title": "Labor would prefer silence on Gaza amid confected outrage at the Greens",
        "body": "If Labor doesn't like the Greens' attacks on the government's stance on Gaza, perhaps it shouldn't hand nearly a billion dollars to an Israeli arms company.\n\nThere's plenty of high dudgeon, long bows and confected outrage flying around in and out of Parliament, with the major parties lining up to denounce the Greens: \"the party of antisemitism\", according to the Coalition; exploiting Palestinians to \"harvest votes\" according to Labor. Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus went further and suggested Adam Bandt had \"something to answer for\" in encouraging violence directed at MPs. Bandt responded this morning by foolishly threatening legal action.\n\nThe Greens' charge that Labor is \"complicit in genocide\" is a long bow. By any dictionary definition, what Israel is doing in Gaza is ethnic cleansing and war crimes, not genocide -- although the latter term in recent decades has been expanded to the point of nebulousness by people looking to accord their causes with the highest possible status.\n\nThe Greens have made much of the fact that an Australian manufacturer contributes a part to the global \"everyone gets a prize\" supply chain for the F-35, part of the US military-industrial complex's means of selling more of its garbage planes. To deem this \"complicity in genocide\" is far-fetched.\n\nBut where the Greens are closer to the mark is in the way the current government is handing nearly a billion dollars to Elbit Systems, an Israeli company that really is complicit in Israel's atrocities and helped kill Zomi Frankcom. Frankcom's murder by the Israeli Defence Forces appears to have slid into a convenient memory hole for both the government and most of the media since early April, with complete silence on any \"investigations\" into the deliberate targeting of Frankcom and her colleagues (Penny Wong was asked about the investigation by SBS two weeks ago and refused to say anything).\n\nLabor would prefer that no-one knew about this handout to Elbit, with defence minister, Elbit spruiker and Labor village idiot Richard Marles stolidly refusing to address why taxpayers are funding companies engaged in helping slaughter Palestinians.\n\nSo, complicit in genocide? Certainly not. But supportive of companies that enable ethnic cleansing, war crimes and mass murder? Absolutely. And Labor's silence on the issue makes it complicit.\n\nLabor has its own long bows and confected outrage -- indeed, much more so than the Greens. The charge that the Greens are inciting violence is without foundation. More offensive is the argument that the Greens are attempting to harvest votes at the expense of Palestinians. Decrying the mass slaughter of Palestinians is somehow, under that logic, harmful to Palestinians, whereas Labor's approach of quietly expressing \"concern\" about each atrocity and calling for a ceasefire is beneficial to them.\n\nWhat Labor is evidently concerned about is that the Greens are on the other side of a generational divide which sees younger Australians more sympathetic to Palestinians and more critical of Israel than the governing class, which has been duchessed by Israel and pro-Israeli lobby groups and friendly media outlets for decades and which reflexively supports Israel. The deliberate conflation of criticism of Israeli atrocities with antisemitism isn't merely a tactic of Israeli apologists, but of establishment political figures unnerved by the tide of public anger at the killing of tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians.\n\nReinforcing this is Labor's treatment of its own Israel critics. Western Australian Senator Fatima Payman has been rebuked by the prime minister and left isolated for her support for Palestinians; pro-Israel NSW Labor leader Chris Minns sacked a frontbencher for entirely justified criticism of the role of NSW police in response to pro-Palestine protests. Federal Labor sided with pro-Israel online activists campaigning to destroy the careers of pro-Palestinian activists and, like Minns, has spoken about hardening \"hate speech\" laws in response to what is described as a surge in antisemitism (and with no substantial mention of the increase in Islamophobia).\n\nYou can't seek to curb the voices of critics of Israel, stay quiet about an Australian murdered by the IDF, isolate and punish pro-Palestinian MPs, and preside over handing nearly a billion dollars to a company complicit in the slaughter of Palestinians, and then complain about the Greens attacking you. Labor would prefer that silence reigned over both Israel's atrocities in Gaza and Australia's links with Israeli companies. The Greens, rightly, want to yell about it.\n\nDo you back Labor or the Greens when it comes to Israel and Palestine? Let us know your thoughts by writing to letters@crikey.com.au.

        "title": "Top Pentagon aide to leave months after Lloyd Austin medical controversy",
        "body": "The chief of staff to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will step down, the Pentagon said Wednesday, months after she drew criticism for not informing the White House and Congress of Austin's emergency hospitalization last winter.\n\nKelly Magsamen will depart at the end of June, Austin said in a statement expressing gratitude for her service over 3 1/2 years. She has served beside him since the beginning of his tenure, a turbulent period that included the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nAustin called her \"the chief architect of every initiative I have launched.\" His statement did not indicate why Magsamen, who was traveling with Austin in France on Wednesday, was leaving. Attempts to reach her for comment were not successful.\n\nMagsamen will be replaced on an acting basis by Caroline Zier, who had been Austin's deputy chief of staff, said a senior defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity ahead of the move becoming official.\n\nMagsamen, who rarely spoke publicly on Austin's behalf, became mired in the political controversy that arose after it was revealed that he had been treated for prostate cancer in December and hospitalized in critical condition for days in January without President Biden being made aware.\n\nAt the time, the Pentagon said not even Magsamen had been told about Austin's cancer diagnosis and surgery. But it later acknowledged that when she and a handful of other top officials did learn Jan. 2 that there were complications and that he had been hospitalized in critical condition, they waited to make the appropriate notifications.\n\nIn attempting to explain the lapse, the Pentagon said Magsamen had been sick that week with the flu, and that Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks, though vacationing in Puerto Rico, had assumed Austin's duties when his surgery was performed. It was later disclosed that Hicks was not told why she would need to do so.\n\nThe Defense Department's independent inspector general opened an investigation in January and is expected to issue a report later this year.\n\nA Pentagon spokeswoman, Sabrina Singh, told reporters later Wednesday that Magsamen has \"earned some well-deserved time off,\" and that her departure has nothing to do with the inspector general's findings.\n\nMollie Halpern, a spokeswoman for the inspector general, said the review is ongoing and that the office would not provide a timeline for its completion \"to protect the integrity of the investigative process.\"\n\nThe episode caused a furor among lawmakers in both political parties, with Democrats lamenting that Austin showed poor judgment and House Republicans summoning him to Capitol Hill for a public dressing-down as he continued to recover in late February.\n\nAustin has apologized for the secrecy surrounding his medical crisis, saying the cancer diagnosis was a \"gut punch\" he was inclined to handle privately, and resisting calls to hold accountable those on his staff who had a duty to alert the president that a key member of his national security team was incapacitated.\n\n\"I want to be crystal clear: We did not handle this right. I did not handle this right,\" Austin said then. \"I should have told the president about my cancer diagnosis. I should have also told my team and the American public, and I take full responsibility. I apologize to my teammates and the American people.\"\n\nThough she preferred to work behind the scenes, Magsamen was moved to speak out last year amid Sen. Tommy Tuberville's months-long hold on hundreds of military promotions.\n\nThe Alabama Republican had challenged Austin over his travel reimbursement policy for military women seeking abortions and other reproductive care out of state after the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in 2022. Frustrated by the partisanship that halted the promotions, Magsamen called attention on social media to an Army general deeply involved in the Pentagon's effort to help Ukraine resist the Kremlin's onslaught.\n\n\"He probably works about 18 hours a day. 7 days a week,\" she wrote, characterizing the general's mandate as \"literally holding the world together.\"\n\nMagsamen has held other senior roles in the U.S. government, serving on the White House's National Security Council under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, as a senior Pentagon official during the Obama administration, and in the State Department from 2005 to 2008. It was not immediately clear what she intends to do next.",

The students have called on the school to divest from companies linked to Israel's war in Gaza, among other demands.\n\nPolice used a crowbar to enter the building about two hours after the demonstration began, according to the Stanford Daily. The university said 13 people had been arrested, one officer was injured, and the building had suffered \"extensive\" damage.\n\nArrested students will be suspended, and any seniors will not be permitted to graduate, the school said.\n\nIn a statement, Saller and the school's provost, Jenny Martinez, said they were \"appalled and deeply saddened\" by the students' actions.\n\nThe university also removed a pro-Palestinian encampment that had stood on campus since April and a pro-Israel display honoring the victims of Hamas' attack on Oct. 7, citing public safety concerns.\n\n\"The situation on campus has now crossed the line from peaceful protest to actions that threaten the safety of our community,\" the school leaders wrote.\n\nThe arrested students included a reporter for the Stanford Daily, the newspaper said.\n\nHundreds of students have been arrested in recent months after staging demonstrations, setting up encampments and in some cases taking over buildings to protest Israel's assault on Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gazan health authorities.\n\nThe Israeli campaign began after Hamas, the militant group that rules Gaza, attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.",

        "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Oil rose in early Asian trading on Thursday on rising expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September, and as the market rebounded from a selloff related to growing U.S. inventories and an OPEC+ plan to increase supply.\n\nBrent crude futures rose 27 cents, or 0.34%, to $78.68 a barrel by 0103 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 36 cents, or 0.49%, to $74.43.\n\nNearly two-thirds of economists are now predicting an interest rate cut in September, according to Reuters' May 31-June 5 poll, offsetting recent bearish supply news.\n\nLower interest rates decrease the cost of borrowing, which can incentivise economic activity and boost oil demand.\n\nTraders are also viewing the selloff on the back of U.S. inventory data as \"overdone\", ANZ analysts said in a note.\n\nPrices initially fell in early trading on Wednesday after U.S. crude stocks jumped by 1.2 million barrels in the week to May 31, compared with analysts' estimates for a draw of 2.3 million barrels, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed.\n\nBut prices later rebounded to end the session up 1% on the view the selloff had been too sharp and on the growing interest rate optimism.\n\nHowever, the Fed's interest rate path is far from a foregone conclusion. U.S. services sector activity, which accounts for the vast majority of the country's economic output, returned to growth in May following a contraction in the previous month, in a shift that could potentially weaken the case for interest rate cuts.\n\nOil prices had fallen after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies agreed on Sunday to extend most of their oil output cuts into 2025 but left room for voluntary cuts from eight members to be unwound gradually, beginning in October.\n\nIn the Middle East, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said on Wednesday the militant group would demand a permanent end to the war in Gaza and Israel's withdrawal as part of a ceasefire plan in what appeared to be a rebuttal to a peace proposal put forward by President Joe Biden, while Israel announced a new military campaign against Hamas.\n\nBritish security firm Ambrey said on Thursday a Greek-owned bulk carrier was allegedly targeted by Yemen's Houthis while travelling northbound in the Red Sea.\n\nHowever, geopolitical risks have taken a backseat to market fundamentals recently.\n\n(Reporting by Colleen Howe; Editing by Jamie Freed)",

At least 81,000 people are estimated to have been injured.",

        "body": "By Middle East correspondent Allyson Horn, Haidarr Jones and Orly Halpern in Jerusalem\n\nViolence has erupted at Israel's annual Jerusalem Day march, with some Jewish Israelis attacking Palestinians and journalists, including an ABC News team, while chanting offensive slogans.\n\nJerusalem Day marks the Israeli capture of East Jerusalem in 1967 and is celebrated by thousands of far-right Israelis and Jews with a march through the Muslim quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem.\n\nExtra police and security forces had been deployed in the area amid heightened tensions from the Israel-Gaza war.\n\nEven before the march began, confrontations erupted inside the Old City, with groups of young right-wing Jews attacking Palestinians and journalists.\n\nThe ABC News team was pushed and verbally abused, with one member hit in the face and pushed, before police intervened.\n\nSome in the groups shouted slogans that included \"Death to Arabs\" and \"Gaza is a cemetery\".\n\nIsraeli and Arab journalists were also kicked and attacked and some required medical treatment.\n\nDuring the march, some of the Israelis also threw bottles and other projectiles at media.\n\nIsrael's police say five Israeli suspects were detained.\n\n\"We strongly condemn any attempt to harm journalists and media personnel carrying out their duties, as well as any other individuals,\" a Police spokesperson said.\n\nOther Israelis danced and sang in circles while waving Israeli flags, reciting nationalistic songs about Israel.\n\nThe Old City of Jerusalem is a historic walled city which is divided into four uneven quarters named for the four major religions and ethnicities in that area. A fifth sector contains Al-Aqsa Mosque and the historical Temple Mount.\n\nThe Damascus Gate where Israeli Jews gathered on Wednesday is one of seven current gates into the city and enters into a pathway between the Muslim and Christian quarters and leads to the Jewish quarter.\n\nThe city falls on the eastern side of Jerusalem which is divided by the internationally recognised 1967 UN borders, with the west belonging to Israel.\n\nIsrael captured East Jerusalem along with the Jordanian-annexed West Bank during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, which began on June 5 and lasted six days.\n\nPalestinians want East Jerusalem, which is illegally occupied by Israel according to international law, as the capital of a future Palestinian state and consider Jerusalem Day a provocation.\n\nPalestinian Mohammed Abu Al-Homos who was in the area during the march said he was attacked.\n\n\"And now there's the flag march and it's chaos and Palestinians are getting beaten,\" he said.\n\nJerusalem resident Efrat Peterzeig said the land belonged to Israel.\n\n\"What occupation? It's ours,\" she said.\n\n\"The Land of Israel was given to the People of Israel, from the Holy One to our forefather Abraham.\n\n\"It's ours and everything that happened here is that we let them stay here.\n\n\"They really weren't supposed to be here. There is no occupation.\"\n\nThe entire area had been cleared of Palestinians, who were asked to stay inside their homes, and shop keepers instructed to shut their businesses.\n\nIsraeli crowds banged on the walls and doors of Palestinian homes and they passed through the Muslim quarter in the Old City.\n\nIsraeli rights groups had appealed to the march organisers to change the route of the procession, away from the Muslim quarter, fearing it would further escalate hostilities between Palestinians and Israelis.",

        "title": "FTC claims Facebook withheld information when buying Instagram and WhatsApp",
        "body": "Meta is having another one of those days where it finds itself in the headlines for all the wrong reasons.\n\nFirst up is the Federal Trade Commission's allegation that Facebook, as the company was called at the time, withheld information from the agency when the FTC was reviewing its acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.\n\nAlthough it cleared the mergers, the FTC sued Meta in 2020 in an attempt to have them unwound. Meta is trying to have the suit thrown out, arguing that it's invested billions in Instagram and WhatsApp and the antitrust agency hasn't demonstrated how consumers are worse off. The FTC now claims that it had only undertaken a \"limited review\" of the deals when they happened \"at Meta's request,\" and it \"now has available vastly more evidence, including pre-acquisition documents Meta did not provide in 2012 and 2014.\"\n\nIt's not clear from the FTC's filing what information Facebook allegedly withheld, though a spokesperson said that \"some items noted in this filing are still under seal.\"\n\nThese days, many regulators view their clearance of the Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions with embarrassment, as they allowed Facebook to snuff out potential competition in the social networking market, leading to a situation today where it's tricky for many people to avoid using a Meta property. If you want to know why Big Tech mergers are these days more likely than not to be blocked in the U.S. and EU, here's the textbook reason.\n\nThat said, unwinding these mergers would be seismic stuff. It wouldn't be entirely unprecedented, as U.K. competition regulators forced Meta to unwind its 2020 purchase of Giphy a couple years ago, but the GIF repository is small-fry compared to Insta and WhatsApp, and a lot more time has passed since those deals went through. Indeed, even when the EU's antitrust authorities fined Facebook $122 million in 2017 for giving them misleading information during the WhatsApp merger, that didn't affect their approval of the deal as such.\n\nSo I'd be surprised if the FTC's latest tactic manages to undo what was done a decade or more ago, no matter how naïve that approval may seem today. But it might at least stop the courts from throwing out the FTC's suit before trial, which is what Meta is hoping will happen.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Europe, the Italian antitrust authority today fined Meta €35 million ($38 million) for \"unfair commercial practices.\" Chump change, yes, but also yet another sign of how the antitrust and privacy regulation worlds are blurring into one another these days. Meta's sin here was not properly informing people signing up for Instagram via the web that their personal data would be used for commercial purposes. Meta says it disagrees with the fine and is assessing its options.\n\nFinally, stepping away from the world of antitrust, a former Meta engineer named Ferras Hamad has sued the company for discrimination and wrongful termination, relating to his February dismissal. According to Reuters, the Palestinian-American engineer says he was fired after \"trying to help fix bugs\" that suppressed Palestinian Instagram posts. Hamad also claims that employees using internal communications systems to mention the deaths of their relatives in Gaza found their messages deleted, and also that Meta investigated workers for using the Palestinian flag emoji, but not the emojis for the Israeli or Ukrainian flags.\n\nThis is by no means the first time that Meta faces allegations of censoring staffers when they try to speak out in support of Palestinians, in the context of the Israel-Gaza war. Last month, around 200 Meta employees wrote to CEO Mark Zuckerberg last month to decry the alleged practice, and human rights groups held coordinated online protests to back them up. Meta has not yet commented on Hamad's suit.",

        "body": "I read an interesting book recently, The Power of Strangers by Joe Keohane. Subtitle is The Benefits of Connecting in a Suspicious World.\n\nI talk to strangers, and very quickly discover they are not really strange at all, in fact, many are a lot like me; living a life and willing to talk about it, even with strangers. In one such encounter I mentioned to a woman that I am in a local ukulele choir which meets every Monday evening. She was new to our area, plays a ukulele and is now a member of our choir... and she is far more accomplished at playing and singing than I am.\n\n(Bugger, that's the last time I mention that!)\n\nMost mornings I ride about 3km to a beach and walk for an hour or so, but with winter setting in and the beach sand having been taken away to be cleaned for the summer, there was not much beach to walk on, so wandering where I could I passed by a young lady who smiled up at me, and we began to chat. Her accent was pretty broad, she was visiting from Belfast, Ireland. She is here with her family, a British soldier and their young son.\n\nHer family is Catholic and it did not go down well that she married a British soldier but she is again a welcome visitor at home. (It's amazing how forgiving a grandparent can be when they meet their newest grandchild.) I asked her about the troubles and how that affects life in Northern Ireland today. The polarisation is still there, but then she made an interesting comment, the two sides of that social/religious divide have chosen sides in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. The Catholics are for the Palestinians. Protestants for the Israelis and the flags are flying all across Belfast.\n\nI got the feeling that the division in Northern Ireland is still quietly simmering beneath the surface, some social changes are slowly happening, abortion is now legal. It was not long ago that a pregnant woman would take an overnight ferry to England and arrive back the following morning, soon enough to avoid any suspicions of what may have been the reason for an absence... mmm, in the club eh? Gay marriage is legal but frowned on in the churches. Civic ceremonies only.\n\nThe conversation regarding the Gaza situation was so much different than one I had on line with a person who likes to push my buttons. He posted, 'I don't understand why the Palestinians do that'.\n\nWe had covered that ground before; he keeps posting YouTube videos of angry Jews berating the stupidity of the Palestinians, how they want to take over Israel, God promised it to Abraham and his descendants in Bible, the book of Genesis (same book where we get the creation story and Noah's flood), and we are his descendants and so forth. The stories are always so strongly defensive of their right to the land and that Palestinians should just disappear. His posts are filled with hate. There is a denial of Palestinian human rights. Interestingly, he also voted NO, a very definitive NO, in The Voice referendum, probably for the same reason, they should fit in or disappear.\n\nSo he calls me Muslim, cites passages from the Koran such as 'everyone is born Muslim' (apparently that is in the Koran, he cites a text reference), but I have tried to remain polite, putting up with soft name calling, me being Muslim for example, being ignorant, being woke. So I address him by his name as I offer a defence, no, explain my stance on humanitarian grounds, citing the history of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict over time, since 1948, the UN plan to have displaced European Jews settle in Palestine, a nation blending two peoples, Israelis and Palestinians, but that the Palestinians have been pushed aside, endured the Nakba, live in virtual imprisonment in Gaza. All is like water of a duck's back, quite irrelevant. October 7, October 7, October 7. Rapes, beheaded babies, and so forth... Yes, I forwarded an Aljazeera documentary which exposed those lies, but you can't trust them to tell the truth, can you!\n\nThe 'debate' becomes ugly despite my efforts at decorum. And is reflective of the debate and protests we see, not just here, as displayed in Parliament today, but all around the world. The weaponising of antisemitism, the power plays by various lobbyists that almost amount to blackmail, the hate speech. The disregarding of the very potent images of the destruction of Gaza to a pile of rubble, the destruction of hospitals, the killing of reporters within Gaza, stifling the access to reporting, the ever so slow delivery of aid, food, water, fuel, medical supplies, but that is not genocide is it? And oh dear, the 'mistake' of blowing up those tents which had just been moved to a safe zone killing 50 or so women and children.\n\nAnd then today, changing the topic, the questioning of Dr Anthony Fauci in the US Congress, belittling him for the work he did during Covid, to be berated, insulted, told he was not worthy of the title 'Doctor', accused of taking kickbacks (OK, no real accusation, but questioned about how much he got paid by the Pharmaceutical companies. Answer, nothing, $0.00). One member of Congress was a doctor at the time, working in a hospital and accused Dr Fauci of making life difficult for unvaccinated people and doctors such as him working, saving lives in hospital wards. The headline WATCH: Brilliant Doctor CONFRONT Fauci on \"Making life difficult for unvaccinated\".\n\nMy posting Dr Fauci's record as a research doctor in developing vaccines and medicines to treat HIV/AIDS among other diseases was poohoo'd as being far less important than a doctor working in a hospital saving lives. Mmmmmm, and then to be called a liar for daring to mention that at the time the internet was full of QAnon conspiracies regarding mask wearing and vaccinations.\n\nThat I got involved in that 'discussion' was probably a big mistake, but it highlights the hate which is so much a part of online discussion, the lack of 'listening', of reasoned debate being ignored or dismissed, of headline type arguments followed by insults if you dare to disagree. And another YouTube video of some one angrily spouting more bullshit.\n\nUnfortunately, the same is evident what should be more civilised debate. The political point scoring in Parliament yesterday regarding the protests and vandalism outside electoral offices, where the Prime Minister said it should stop, and that descended into the Leader of the Opposition accusing the Greens of orchestrating that... that may not be the exact words, but that was the implication.\n\nPolitics here has become hate-filled, debates reduced to headline grabbing one liners, where detail is given, the call for detail as in the announcement to encourage permanent residents to join our military as a pathway to citizenship, outlining both a time table and who will be encouraged to join up, in other words, don't listen, more detail, don't listen, more detail.",

The burning of fossil fuels -- oil, gas and coal -- is the main contributor to global heating caused by human activity.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization said the global mean near-surface temperature for each year from 2024 to 2028 is expected to range between 1.1 and 1.9 degrees Celsius hotter than at the start of the industrial era.\n\nThe landmark Paris Climate Accord of 2015 set a target of keeping the rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\n\"Beyond the predictions and statistics is the stark reality that we risk trillions of dollars in economic losses, millions of lives upended and destruction of fragile and precious ecosystems and the biodiversity that exists there,\" Ko Barrett, the WMO's deputy secretary-general, told a news conference in Geneva.\n\n\"What is clear is that the Paris agreement target of 1.5 degrees Celsius is hanging on a thread. It's not yet dead, but it's hanging by a thread,\" she added.\n\n\"This forecast is affirmation that the world has entered a climate where years that are as hot as 2023 should no longer be a surprise,\" Noah Diffenbaugh, a professor at Stanford's Doerr School of Sustainability, said in an email.",

        "title": "The Hamas Role in the Worst Massacre of Gay People in America | Frontpage Mag",
        "body": "Nearly eight years after a Muslim terrorist committed the largest massacre of gay people in American history, LGBTQ Islamic terror supporters blocked the Philadelphia gay pride parade.\n\n\"Long live the Intifada,\" members of Queers4Palestine chanted, referring to the Islamic terrorist campaign against the Jewish State, chanting that the gay pride parade was just like the KKK and the Israeli army. \"From the sea to the river, Palestine will live forever!\"\n\nProtesting a gay pride parade in support of Hamas was a fitting prelude to the anniversary of the Islamic massacre at a gay nightclub which had its own Hamas connection.\n\nOn June 12th, 2016, Omar Mateen, an Afghan Muslim, conducted his own 'intifada' at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, murdering 49 people and wounding over 50 more partygoers.\n\nThe terrorist attack at a gay nightclub is commemorated every year in the gay community without a single reference to the fact that Omar was a Muslim terrorist killing for Islam.\n\nEven though Omar Mateen had told coworkers that he had ties to Islamic terrorism, had been investigated by the FBI as an Islamic terrorist (he had convinced the FBI that his coworkers were 'Islamophobes') and there are recordings of him pledging allegiance to ISIS during the attack, every anniversary of the Pulse nightclub massacre makes no mention of the \"I\" word.\n\n\"My name is Islamic soldier,\" Omar had told a law enforcement negotiator. \"It's the last month of the Ramadan... I fasted the whole day today. I fasted and I prayed.\"\n\nOmar had come from an Islamic terrorist supporting family. His father, who had run for president of Afghanistan, had publicly praised the Taliban. And there was also a Hamas connection.\n\nOmar's wife, Noor Salman, was born to 'Palestinian' parents and her first marriage had been arranged in her father's \"hometown\" in Israel's West Bank. The Salman family owns extensive property in the area including businesses and an apartment in which they live part of the time.\n\nHer mother had cheered Hamas.\n\n\"How many snipers from Palestine deserve a bow from our heads as respect to them?\" she had posted on Oct 6, 2013, and expressed her support for Hamas official Jamal Al-Taweel.\n\n\"My brother and friend, Jamal, rest assured that you are backed by a sister who prays for you night and day, asking Allah to release you from your imprisonment,\" she posted.\n\n\"A photo included with the post praises one fighter who 'killed 11 Zionists.'\"\n\nOne of Salman's sisters had posted \"Solidarity with Gaza.\"\n\nThe Pulse terrorist's 'Palestinian' wife was arrested and charged with providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization and misleading law enforcement about the attack.\n\nAccording to authorities, Noor Salman had admitted that she was aware that her husband had bought a rifle, was watching terrorist videos and had even asked her, \"What would make people more upset, an attack at Disney or a nightclub?\"\n\n\"I knew he was going to do something,\" she later told the FBI.\n\nBefore the attack, Omar told his 'Palestinian' wife, \"this is the day\". The Justice Department alleged that, \"Salman told the FBI that she contrived a cover story\" and that when \"she was initially questioned by the FBI, Defendant Salman steadfastly claimed to have no knowledge of her husband's plan to commit an attack or his support for terrorist organizations.\"\n\nDefense attorneys claimed Salman had a low IQ and had been tired during her interrogation. A coalition of Islamist, anti-Israel and LGBTQ groups rallied to her defense, contending that she was the real victim because of \"Islamophobia.\" And a jury chose not to convict her.\n\nSalman was defended by the Muslim Legal Fund of America. The chairman of MLFA is Hatem Bazian: a key figure in the anti-Israel and pro-Hamas movement leading protests in America.\n\nHatem Bazian, who had a long career of campus antisemitic incitement, co-founded Students for Justice in Palestine whose chapters went on to endorse the Hamas atrocities of Oct 7, and is the co-founder of American Muslims for Palestine which was recently sued by terror victims alleging that the group is providing \"continuous, systematic, and substantial assistance to Hamas and its affiliates' acts of international terrorism.\" AMP is being represented by MLFA.\n\nThe intimate connection between the pro-Hamas protests and the Pulse massacre is an indictment of groups like Queers4Palestine which take part in a movement that is killing them.\n\nThe argument against groups such as \"Queers for Palestine\" is often tied to how Hamas treats gay people in Gaza, but as the Pulse massacre shows, that's not just an issue in Gaza.\n\nIt's just as much of an issue for a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida.\n\nHamas is part of the larger Muslim Brotherhood network. That network includes not only most Islamist groups in America, but also Al Qaeda, which was dominated by a Brotherhood splinter group which in turn helped spin off Al Qaeda in Iraq or ISIS. Omar Mateen pledged his allegiance to ISIS during the Pulse attack after previously claiming to support Al Qaeda and Hezbollah: an Iranian backed terrorist group allied with Hamas that is also waging war on Israel.\n\nThe Brotherhood's bloody fingerprints ultimately extend to the worst massacre of gay people. Organizations within its network then rallied to support and defend the killer's 'Palestinian' wife.\n\nWhen American gay rights groups rally for 'Palestine', Gaza and Hamas, they're not just supporting the murder of gay people thousands of miles away, but also their own murders.",

My concern is that if we set this precedent, our scope of business will be taken to heights that aren't in our bounds.\"\n\nThere were several community members who agreed.\n\n\"I believe this resolution has exceeded the governing role of the council,\" pastor Brent Aucoin said at the council meeting.\n\n\"West Lafayette seems to be a pretty small council,\" Purdue alum Vivian Jung said. \"I doubt it would make a federal impact.\"\n\nPete, who wished to keep his last name private because he is a military service member, said while studying in the WALC that he thought the level of conflict between Israel and Palestine was not likely to change.\n\n\"I am not in the belief it would have any effect on what's going on, and I have studied this issue,\" he said. \"Many years of bad blood, one small town in Indiana isn't going to make a change.\"\n\nAmong the organizations that pushed for the city council resolution in the first place, one issued a statement rebuking the council's decision.\n\n\"As citizens of a region that is currently seeing an expansion of military-industrial complex investment, we do not view this as some far away \"international\" issue, but something that touches all of our lives,\" Greater Lafayette Democratic Socialists of America said in a release.\n\nDaniel Chase, whose Facebook profile says he lives in Lafayette, said that if \"a lot of towns\" passed a ceasefire, it could help. \"But I don't see one town making a huge dent,\" he said.\n\nGLDS co-chair Charles Campbell referenced The Nation magazine, a progressive monthly publication, saying \"at least 100 municipalities around the United States have already passed resolutions similar to the one put before the West Lafayette Council.\"\n\n\"Over the past few months, the position of the Biden administration has noticeably shifted from full support of Israel's actions towards tentative support for a ceasefire,\" Campbell said.\n\n\"It seems reasonable to conclude that public outcry at the grassroots has contributed to this shift at the federal level.\"",

GDI aims to foster a new momentum for the global common development,\" he said.\n\nOuyang said China is willing to explore the best ways to synergize the GDI with ASEAN's Community Vision 2045, and accelerate negotiations on version 3.0 of the China-ASEAN free trade areas. China is also ready to work with ASEAN countries in more effectively implementing the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.\n\nMohd Faiz Abdullah, chairman of the Institute of Strategic and International Studies, or ISIS, Malaysia, in his opening address, highlighted the challenges facing the current international order, including the shift from unipolarity to multipolarity and the growing influence of emerging middle and major powers.\n\n\"What is clear is that unipolarity, and perhaps even bipolarity, is on its way out,\" Mohd Faiz said.\n\nThe forum, held in Kuala Lumpur from Tuesday to Thursday, was convened by ISIS Malaysia and organized on behalf of the ASEAN Institute of Strategic and International Studies.\n\nComplex landscape\n\nMore than 100 delegates, including some of Southeast Asia's key business executives, experts, and government officials attended the high-level symposium to discuss the increasingly complex strategic landscape and how this affects the global order.\n\nFor the Global South, the choice is not whether to side with China or the United States, said Victor Gao Zhikai, vice-president of the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization.\n\n\"The real choice is between whether China or the United States -- or both China and the United States -- are doing the right thing or the wrong thing,\" he said.\n\n\"If China does the right thing, we want to learn from it. If the United States is doing the wrong thing, why do we follow their footsteps?\"\n\nDespite the fluctuation in bilateral relations, staging a war will never be an option for the two countries, said Gao, one of the speakers at a panel discussion on major power rivalry.\n\n\"All of us need to promote or instigate for peace, rather than agitate for war between China and the United States,\" Gao said, adding that no one will benefit from any conflict.\n\nWhile there are concerns about how the US presidential election in November might affect bilateral relations, Gao said he believes there will be \"inevitable peace\" between the two countries.\n\nYun Sun, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center in Washington, said the two sides have been conducting dialogue and strengthening cooperation in several areas.\n\n\"We're also seeing cooperation for possible joint law enforcement (and) contract audits. We're seeing discussions about issues including the Gaza crisis,\" Yun said.\n\n\"So, we are basically seeing a lot of (cooperation) activities happening between the two, which then helps to mitigate the tense relations.\"\n\nYun said the results of the US presidential election are unlikely to affect US policy on China because Washington maintains \"continuity and consistency on some of the approaches to China\".\n\nHerve Lemahieu, director of research at the Lowy Institute in Australia, said he is optimistic about Asia-Pacific, noting that the region has not seen conflicts such as that happening in Europe and the Middle East.\n\n\"So, there is still hope in Asia for us to avoid the worst,\" Lemahieu said.",

        "title": "In apparent blow to Biden plan, Hamas leader demands full end to Gaza",
        "body": "Biden announced truce proposal without warning Israelis, US officials say\n\nCAIRO/JERUSALEM: The leader of Hamas said on Wednesday the group would demand a permanent end to the war in Gaza and Israeli withdrawal as part of a ceasefire plan, dealing an apparent blow to a truce proposal touted last week by US President Joe Biden.\n\nIsrael, meanwhile, said there would be no halt to fighting during ceasefire talks, and launched a new assault on a central section of the Gaza Strip near the last city yet to be stormed by its tanks.\n\nThe remarks by Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh appeared to deliver the Palestinian militant group's reply to the proposal that Biden unveiled last week. Washington had said it was waiting to hear an answer from Hamas to what Biden described as an Israeli initiative.\n\n\"The movement and factions of the resistance will deal seriously and positively with any agreement that is based on a comprehensive ending of the aggression and the complete withdrawal and prisoners swap,\" Haniyeh said.\n\nAsked whether Haniyeh's remarks amounted to the group's reply to Biden, a senior Hamas official replied to a text message from Reuters with a \"thumbs up\" emoji.\n\nWashington is still pressing hard to reach an agreement. CIA director William Burns met senior officials from mediators Qatar and Egypt on Wednesday in Doha to discuss the ceasefire proposal.\n\nSince a brief week-long truce in November, all attempts to arrange a ceasefire have failed, with Hamas insisting on its demand for a permanent end to the conflict, while Israel says it is prepared to discuss only temporary pauses until the militant group is defeated.\n\nBiden has repeatedly declared that ceasefires were close over the past several months, only for no truce to materialize. Notably, Biden said in February that Israel agreed to a ceasefire by the start of the Ramadan Muslim holy month on March 10, a deadline which passed with military operations in full swing.\n\nBut last week's announcement came with far greater fanfare from the White House, and at a time when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under mounting domestic political pressure to chart a path to end the eight-month-old war and negotiate the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nThree US officials told Reuters that Biden, having obtained Israel's agreement for the proposal, had deliberately announced it without warning the Israelis he would do so, to narrow the room for Netanyahu to back away.\n\n\"We didn't ask permission to announce the proposal,\" said a senior US official granted anonymity to speak freely about the negotiations. \"We informed the Israelis we were going to give a speech on the situation in Gaza. We did not go into great detail about what it was.\"\n\nHamas, which rules Gaza, precipitated the war by attacking Israeli territory on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Around half of the hostages were freed in the war's only truce so far, which lasted a week in November.\n\nIsrael's military assault on Gaza has killed more than 36,000 people, according to health officials in the territory, who say thousands more dead are feared buried under the rubble.\n\nIsrael lukewarm\n\nAlthough Biden described the ceasefire proposal as an Israeli offer, Israel's government has been lukewarm in public. A top Netanyahu aide confirmed on Sunday Israel had made the proposal even though it was \"not a good deal.\"\n\nFar-right members of Netanyahu's government have pledged to quit if he agrees to a peace deal that leaves Hamas in place, a move that could force a new election and end the political career of Israel's longest-serving leader. Centrist opponents who joined Netanyahu's war cabinet in a show of unity at the outset of the conflict have also threatened to quit, saying his government has no plan.\n\nMeanwhile, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said there would be no let-up in Israel's offensive while negotiations over the ceasefire proposal were under way.\n\n\"Any negotiations with Hamas would be conducted only under fire,\" Gallant said in remarks carried by Israeli media after he flew aboard a warplane to inspect the Gaza front.\n\nIsrael announced a new operation against Hamas in central Gaza on Wednesday, where Palestinian medics said airstrikes had killed dozens of people.\n\nEarly on Thursday, the Hamas-run Gaza government media office said Israeli missiles killed at least 27 people and injured dozens who were sheltering at a UN school in Nuseirat in central Gaza.\n\nIsrael's military said there was a Hamas compound inside the school and fighters who took part in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel \"were eliminated.\" It said that before the strike by Israeli fighter jets, the military took steps to reduce the risk of harm to civilians. There was no immediate comment from Hamas.\n\nThe armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they had fought gunbattles with Israeli forces on Wednesday in areas throughout the enclave and fired anti-tank rockets and shells.\n\nTwo children were among the dead laid out on Wednesday in the city's Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, one of the last hospitals functioning in Gaza. Mourners said the children had been killed along with their mother, who had been unable to leave when others in the neighborhood did.\n\n\"This is not war, it is destruction that words are unable to express,\" said their father Abu Mohammed Abu Saif.",

        "body": "CODEPINK Inland Empire and CODEPINK Southeast LA joined a coalition of peace activists at last night's live taping of Vice President Kamala Harris' appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live. The activists, representing groups such as Chino Valley for Palestinian Liberation, Palestinian Christians for Justice, Pasadena for Palestine, Claremont Graduate Students for a Free Palestine, and autonomous residents of Los Angeles, were there to remind people that there is no business as usual during a genocide.\n\nSecurity approached a few of the audience's peace activists, pulled them aside before Vice President Harris arrived onstage, and forced them to leave. After Harris was introduced and seated, the activists set off a chain of disruptions that led to the illegal detainment and physical assault of some of the activists by security. The activists were told they were under arrest, despite no one having Miranda rights read or anyone showing badges or authority to make an arrest. Activists were being illegally detained and were told to turn over their IDs. When activists asserted their First Amendment rights and attempted to leave the premises, some were physically restrained with excessive force, and the gates of the building were locked by security, illegally imprisoning the peaceful demonstrators.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FOOTAGE OF DISRUPTIONS AND ASSAULTS AND ASSAULTS\n\nAt one point, a security guard put one of the activists in chokehold until others were able to get him to release him. As clearly shown in the video, this act of violence was unprovoked and completely unnecessary.\n\nThe coalition of organizations demand The Jimmy Kimmel Show address and apologize for the unnecessary use of brutal force that left the man bruised and swollen.\n\nCODEPINK Inland Empire member Rachael O'Neill explained, \"We reject business as usual as the Israeli government carries out a genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, all with the unconditional support of the Biden/Harris administration. We took this action today to put pressure on the administration to back up their words with actions: stop arming Israel and support a permanent ceasefire resolution at the UN.\"\n\nAfter being detained in the building's atrium, security finally unlocked the gates and released the activists without further incident. They joined the other previously removed activists outside for a Free Palestine rally.\n\nThe protest comes as the genocide in Gaza enters its ninth month, with reports of nearly 40,000 Palestinian lives lost. Activists criticize the Biden administration for its continued support of Israeli military actions. Organizers note that Harris has taken to the campaign trail to talk about the need to protect women's rights while signing off on sending bombs that have killed and maimed over 20,000 women and children in Gaza.\n\nThe demands for immediate action - an arms embargo and cessation of aid to Israel, alongside a call for a permanent ceasefire to end the ongoing violence and humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the West Bank - are echoed across the country as the movement for a Free Palestine grows and Israel's apparent intent to cleanse Palestinians ethnically becomes more evident.\n\nImages, videos and interviews with the activists are available upon request.",

        "title": "Startups' new strategy to cut costs; unprecedented poll buzz online",
        "body": "Happy Thursday! While layoffs continue, startups are strategically refilling certain open positions with lower-salaried junior staff to cut costs. This in today's ETtech Morning Dispatch.\n\nAlso in the letter:\n\n■ Online scamsters target Gaza charities\n\n■ Lenders vs Byju's, again\n\n■ ETtech Done Deals\n\nAs part of cost-cutting exercises, major startups are replacing a section of highly-paid employees impacted by layoffs with people joining at lower salaries or with lesser experience, industry executives and consultants told ET.\n\nDriving the news: During such replacement hiring, new hires tend to get paid 15-20% lesser than their predecessors. However, this is not a direct replacement, and overall team sizes inevitably shrink after such major layoffs. Teams working on new business ventures or \"moonshot ideas\" are often not replaced during cost-cutting exercises.\n\nDeep trouble: Amid a continued funding crunch and increased focus on profitability, startups have been hit by large-scale layoffs. While online retailer Flipkart laid off 1,100-1,500 employees, Paytm let go of more than 1,000, and Swiggy fired about 400. ET reported on June 3 that IPO-bound Ola Electric is finalising plans to cut 400-500 jobs, just weeks after sister firm Ola Cabs laid off around 200 staffers.\n\nNitty gritties: Replacement hirings tend to happen more in high-compensation teams like product and engineering, while inside teams the impact of layoffs is often on higher-paid employees. At senior levels like vice president and above, new hirings are happening at about 20-25% lower salaries, while startups are also increasingly looking internally to fill up senior positions.\n\nHiring afresh: Major startups are also changing their hiring strategies, including looking beyond 'Tier 1' colleges like the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) to hire employees at more rationalised salaries. Talent from lesser-known colleges now have better resources to improve their fundamental skills, while things like quality contributions to Github or Stack Overflow are also becoming vital for recruiters.\n\nThe internet has been at witter with polling buzz since election results started unfolding on Tuesday, with netizens posting memes, comments and even some educational information on the polls.\n\nTrending: As per Google Trends, keywords like 'India PM', 'share market', 'Amethi', 'Varanasi', 'Naveen Patnaik', 'Nitish Kumar' were hot topics, crossing 500,000 searches each over the last 24 hours.\n\nEducating the masses: Educational YouTube channels such as ThinkSchool, Drishti IAS, StudyIQ IAS and World Affairs by Unacademy cashed in on the poll fervour and posted video explainers on political developments about one of the most interesting elections in India's history.\n\nAakash Banerjee, a YouTuber, journalist, radio jockey and political satirist, who goes by the handle @TheDeshBhakt has been consistently active with explainer videos about state-wise polling situations keeping up the twists and turns every hour.\n\nOnline scamsters are using the viral 'All Eyes on Rafah' campaign as an opportunity to dupe people who want to lend a helping hand or donate to victims of the war in Gaza.\n\nPhishing for trouble: Email security providers have seen a surge in phishing attempts, while consumer protection agencies are reporting a higher number of complaints about fake charities for Gaza. Intending to send money to the war victims, many may be routing their money to Ghaziabad, or elsewhere in their eagerness to contribute, experts said.\n\nTell me more: The most common scams related to Gaza include fake websites, fake cryptocurrency links, phishing emails, fake video links, and social media scams.\n\nScammers set up fraudulent websites that mimic legitimate aid organisations, use phishing emails that appear to be from reputable charities to steal personal information, and circulate fake video links that lead to malicious sites.\n\nOnline concerns: Social media monitoring tools have tracked a 40% increase in scam-related content since the 'All Eyes on Rafah' movement gained momentum, while reports indicate a 60% increase in phishing emails purporting to be from legitimate aid organisations, Kanishk Gaur, chief executive of digital risk management firm Athenian Tech, told ET.\n\nA section of Byju's term loan lenders is seeking to initiate Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings against the edtech's subsidiaries Epic, Tynker, and Osmo, in a Delaware court.\n\nCase details: In a statement, the group of lenders said this move is to protect and maximise the value of Byju's US-based operating entities for the benefit of all stakeholders and prevent further diversion of assets and corporate mismanagement.\n\nThe lenders have been in negotiations with Byju's over the prepayment of a $1.2-billion term loan taken by its US subsidiary, Byju's Alpha, and the legal tussle continues in US courts.\n\nRecap: This comes a month after the lenders said the US bankruptcy court was set to penalise the edtech's board member Riju Ravindran for not disclosing or ascertaining the location of the term loan money. The court said Ravindran's testimoney \"lacked all credibility\" and subsequently found him in contempt.\n\nLending startup Fibe closes $90 million financing: Pune-based lending startup Fibe has raised $90 million in fresh equity funding. Of this, around $66 million is in primary money, cofounder Akshay Mehrotra told us. The rest is in secondary share sale, where new investors buy part-stakes from existing investors.\n\nNazara subsidiary buys entertainment news site for $1.4 million: Absolute Sports, a subsidiary of listed media and gaming firm Nazara Technologies, said it will acquire entertainment content provider SoapCentral for $1.4 million (Rs 11 crore) in an all-cash deal.\n\nOnline travel aggregator Ixigo sets Rs 88-93 price band for Rs 740-crore IPO: Le Travenues Technology, the parent company of online travel aggregator Ixigo, on Wednesday set a price band of Rs 88-93 per share for its initial public offering. The IPO is scheduled to launch on June 10 and close on June 12, to raise a total of Rs 740 crore through the public issue.\n\nStock prices of new-age firms swing on poll results: Major new-age companies including Zomato, Paytm, Delhivery, Nykaa and PB Fintech saw their stock prices fall on Tuesday. However, they were back up on Wednesday as the broader markets recovered some losses.\n\nSAP aims to double embedded AI use cases to 100 by year-end: CEO | German multinational software company SAP is betting big on business AI as a differentiator and aims to double the number of embedded AI use cases on its platform to 100 by the end of the year.\n\n■ The future of Netflix games could look like reality TV (The Verge)\n\n■ The near future of deepfakes just got way clearer after India's elections (The Atlantic)\n\n■ Why bigger EVs aren't always better (MIT Technology Review)",

        "title": "A cease-fire in the Gaza Strip might be the easy part. Fulfilling it will be harder",
        "body": "The proposal backed by President Biden is deeply political and aims at stopping the war at least for now. But Israel rejects a permanent cease-fire and Hamas has its own reasons for reluctance.\n\nEven as Hamas and the Israeli government appear to be inching closer to a cease-fire agreement, analysts are deeply sceptical that the sides will ever implement a deal that goes beyond a temporary truce.\n\nAt issue is a three-phase agreement, proposed by Israel and backed by the United States and some Arab countries, which if fully realised could eventually see the total withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip, the return of all remaining hostages captured in the October 7 attack and a reconstruction plan for the territory.\n\nBut making it to that finish line is impossible if the parties are unwilling to even start the race or to agree on where it should end. Fundamentally, the wrangling is not just about the how long a cease-fire in Gaza should last or at what point it should be implemented, but whether Israel can ever accept a long-term truce as long as Hamas retains significant control.\n\nFor Israel to agree to Hamas' demands for a permanent cease-fire from the start, it must acknowledge that Hamas will remain undestroyed and will play a role in the territory's future, conditions Israel's government cannot abide. On the flip side, Hamas says it won't consider a temporary cease-fire without the guarantees of a permanent one that effectively ensures its survival, even at the cost of countless more Palestinian lives, lest Israel restart the war once its hostages are returned.\n\nYet after eight months of a grinding war, there are signs that the sides could be moving closer to the first proposed phase: a six-week conditional cease-fire. While that step is hardly guaranteed, getting to the plan's second phase, which envisages a permanent cessation of hostilities and the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, is even more unlikely, analysts said.\n\n\"It is wrong to see this proposal as more than a stopgap,\" said Natan Sachs, director of the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution. \"Most important, this plan doesn't answer the fundamental question of who rules Gaza after the conflict. This is a cease-fire plan, not a day-after plan.\"\n\nThe leaders of Hamas and the Israeli government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are considering what the deal will mean not only for the future of the war, but for their own political futures. In order to get buy-in from sceptical partners for the first stage of the plan, Netanyahu is especially incentivized to keep his commitments to the latter phases vague.\n\nIn each camp are influential figures willing to prolong the war. Some inside Hamas say the group, dominated by those still in Gaza, like local leader Yahya Sinwar, should not agree to any deal that does not immediately create a permanent cease-fire. In Israel, the mere mention of stopping the war and a full troop withdrawal has led Netanyahu's far-right allies to threaten to bring down his government.\n\nAt a news conference Tuesday, Osama Hamdan, a Hamas spokesperson, said the group would not approve an agreement that does not begin with the promise of a permanent cease-fire and include provisions for the total withdrawal of Israeli troops and a \"serious and real deal\" to exchange the remaining hostages for a much larger number of Palestinian prisoners being held in Israel.\n\nShlomo Brom, a retired brigadier general and senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies, said that \"clearly to everyone this proposal is mostly political.\"\n\n\"The first stage is good for Netanyahu, because some hostages will be freed,\" Brom said. \"But he'll never get to the second stage. As before, he'll find something wrong in what Hamas does, which will not be difficult to find.\"\n\nMore than 100 hostages were released under a more limited deal in November, which lasted roughly a week. Netanyahu said Hamas had not produced all female hostages as promised; Hamas said Israel rejected alternatives. As the truce expired, Hamas launched rockets into Israel. Since then, the war has continued unbated.\n\nThere is no guarantee this time, either, that the first phase will be succeeded by the second. That might suit Netanyahu fine, analysts agreed, pacifying the Americans with a temporary cease-fire and increased aid to Gaza while finding reasons not to move beyond that agreement.\n\nNetanyahu is hoping, analysts said, that Hamas will not agree to the proposal at all, and thus get him off the hook. As hostilities with Hezbollah heat up in the north, he is suggesting to his allies that even if he must agree to the Gaza proposal, negotiations on the second stage could go on indefinitely.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who laid out the plan from the White House last week, has his own political considerations in having the sides agree, sooner rather than later. He clearly wants a halt to the Gaza war well before the presidential election in November, said Aaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Carnegie Endowment, adding, \"The only party really in a hurry is Biden.\"\n\nSo Biden is pressing Netanyahu and Hamas to accept the agreement quickly.\n\nAs Israeli troops have reached the Egyptian border and the war's major operations wind down, the president has said Hamas is no longer capable of carrying out another October 7-style attack and is pushing Netanyahu to publicly accept his own proposal.\n\nNetanyahu has done his best to confuse everyone about his intentions, denying that his goal of dismantling Hamas has changed and refusing to support a permanent end to the fighting, which he called \"a nonstarter\" on Sunday.\n\nBiden also emphasized that Hamas \"should take the deal,\" which it has not accepted, only saying that it views the proposal \"positively.\"\n\nThe proposal, as explained by Biden and his officials, has three stages.\n\nIn the first phase, both sides would observe a six-week cease-fire. Israel would withdraw from major population centres in Gaza and a number of hostages would be released, including women, the elderly and the wounded. The hostages would be exchanged for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees, their names still to be negotiated. Aid would begin flowing into Gaza, working up to some 600 trucks a day. Displaced Palestinian civilians would be allowed to return to their homes in northern Gaza.\n\nDuring the first phase, Israel and Hamas would continue to negotiate to reach the second phase: a permanent cease-fire, the withdrawal of all Israeli troops from Gaza and the freeing of all remaining living hostages. If the talks take more than six weeks, the first phase of the truce will continue until they reach a deal, Biden said.\n\nIf they ever do.\n\nIsraeli officials from Netanyahu on down have insisted that Israel must retain security control over Gaza in the future, making it highly unlikely that they would agree to withdraw Israeli troops entirely from the buffer zone they have built inside Gaza. And even if they do, Israel insists on the ability to go in and out of Gaza whenever it deems necessary to combat remaining or reestablished Hamas or other fighters, as it now does in the West Bank.\n\nAs a former senior intelligence officer said, bluntly, \"There is no good solution here and everyone knows it.\"\n\nStopping the war without ensuring Hamas can't come back presents a real dilemma, he said. But is it realistic to expect that continuing the war will achieve this aim? The release of the hostages -- an estimated 125 of whom are still being held by Hamas and other armed groups in Gaza, though dozens are believed to be dead -- is a top priority, but it's unclear if continuing the war increases the pressure on Hamas to make a deal for their freedom or puts the hostages who are still alive in further danger. And even if Israel stops the war after so many months of captivity, their release could take more time than they have.\n\nThe timing may also work for an agreement on the first phase, because Israel is fighting to complete its military control over Rafah, in southernmost Gaza, and the Egyptian border. The fighting, which Israel has undertaken with fewer troops, less bombing and more care for civilians after American pressure, is expected to take two or three more weeks, Israeli officials suggest, roughly the time it would take to negotiate the first phase of the cease-fire agreement.\n\nIsraeli troops are moving slowly into the more populated areas of Rafah city, pushing civilians to evacuate farther west, toward the coast and areas officially designated as safe spaces, even if housing, water, food and health care are rudimentary at best and civilians continue to die from Israeli strikes.\n\nAccording to Israeli officials and the Institute for the Study of War, which is tracking the conflict, \"Israeli forces continue clearing operations in central Rafah\" and \"intelligence-based, targeted operations.\" They raided what Israel called \"an active combat complex\" Monday and carried out drone and airstrikes on what was called a \"Hamas weapons production site in Rafah.\" Hamas fighters have responded with mortars along the border, roadside bombs and rocket-propelled grenades.\n\nWith Hamas forces effectively dismantled as organized units, and fighting almost exclusively as small bands, Israel can declare the major war in Gaza over, analysts said, while continuing to battle Hamas and other fighters where they emerge or are still concentrated, opening the way for a temporary cease-fire.\n\n\"Israel has done a lot, with Hamas dramatically degraded,\" Sachs said. But Israel has put nothing in place to administer Gaza when the military pulls back.\n\nBrom concurred that Israel's military had made real progress. \"My interpretation,\" he said, \"is that the military and terrorist capabilities of Hamas are weakened terribly.\" It is always difficult to declare victory in such an asymmetrical conflict, he said. \"Did we win against Islamic State? It still exists and operates,\" but much diminished.\n\nDespite incessant American prodding, the analysts said, Netanyahu has refused to decide who or what will govern Gaza, if not Hamas.\n\n\"It should be an integrated political and military strategy, but the political side is completely lacking,\" Brom said. \"We can prevent Hamas from ruling Gaza, but who will replace them? That's the Achilles' heel of the whole operation.\"",

        "body": "Israel used fake social media accounts to influence US politicians and the public with pro-Israel information during its fight with Hamas in Gaza, a recent report reveals.\n\nAn article from The New York Times states that Israel's Ministry of Diaspora Affairs, which connects Jews abroad to Israel, oversaw the effort last year. The campaign continues on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nAccording to anonymous officials and research, ChatGPT, an AI chatbot, created much of the content. The tweets reportedly promoted Israeli military money, specifically targeting Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has reaffirmed the US's support for Israel despite his recent declaration that he would not arm it in the event of an invasion of Rafah. Last week, the Biden administration denied that Israel's fatal assault in Gaza, which killed at least 45 people, crossed US red lines.\n\nChatGPT, an AI-powered chatbot, generated several campaign postings. The organization also created three bogus English-language news websites with pro-Israel material.\n\nFour Ministry of Diaspora Affairs members and campaign papers confirmed the Israeli government's influence operation, which was previously unknown. In March, Israeli disinformation watchdog FakeReporter discovered the campaign.\n\nIsrael aimed to influence American opinion on the Gaza crisis through the undercover initiative. Many Americans have criticized President Joe Biden's $15 billion military aid plan for Israel despite the US's longstanding support for Israel. Increasing civilian fatalities in Gaza have prompted some to urge Mr. Biden to remove backing for Israel.\n\nFakeReporter found that the campaign developed three fake news sites, including Non-Agenda and UnFold Magazine, that took and rewrote CNN and Wall Street Journal content to boost Israel's military stance.\n\nSocial media experts highlighted that this was the first time the Israeli government organized a campaign to influence the US. Coordinated actions are widespread globally, but experts admit they are hard to prove. It is believed that Iran, North Korea, China, Russia, and the US sponsor such global efforts, usually through private corporations or intermediaries.\n\nRead Also: Viral Video Captures 'Ugliest Fish' Lurking on Singapore Beach, Terrifying People Online\n\nAchiya Schatz, executive director of FakeReporter, described Israel's intervention as careless and likely useless, underscoring the irresponsibility of intervening in US politics.\n\nIsrael's Ministry of Diaspora Affairs denied involvement in the campaign and denied ties to political marketing firm Stoic based in Tel Aviv. According to the report, the Israeli government has never coordinated a campaign against the US government.\n\nLast week, Meta said they disrupted some accounts involved in the campaign, USA Today reported. The bogus profiles had over 40,000 followers on X, Facebook, and Instagram, but Meta suspected many were bots, limiting their audience.\n\nPoliticians use social media campaigns to sway public opinion. In May, TikTok reported disrupting over a dozen similar attempts, including one from China.\n\nSince October 7th, Israelis and Palestinians have used social media to rally support, much like in the Ukraine war. More than 37,000 Palestinians have perished under Israel's Gaza blockade, according to The Verge.\n\nThe United States is Israel's biggest ally and arms supplier. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will address the US Congress this summer.",

        "body": "Since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, Israel's Ministry of Diaspora Affairs has unleashed a slew of bot users on social media websites to spread Israeli propaganda, often targeting Black U.S. lawmakers' posts, The New York Times reported Wednesday, citing documents and Israeli officials. The ministry paid $2 million to Stoic, a political advocacy firm, to launch the campaign, the Times reported. Stoic created fake news sites such as 'UnFold Magazine' and 'Non-Agenda' which were populated with rewritten articles from other publications that affirmed the Israeli narrative on the war in Gaza.\n\nFakeReporter, a site that reports bot accounts spreading propaganda, originally identified the influx of accounts spreading stories from these sites, among other fake sites promoting racist and fictitious stories, across X, Instagram and Facebook in April.\n\nThe campaign also targeted primarily Black and Democratic lawmakers with spam posts from fake accounts promoting Israeli propaganda, according to the Times. The accounts also used ChatGPT to write posts with identical phrases popping up on many of the accounts. Both ChatGPT and Meta confirmed the Times' and FakeReporter's investigation.
