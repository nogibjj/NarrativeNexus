        "body": "Manila, Jun 4 (AP) The Philippine military chief on Tuesday said the Chinese coast guard seized one of four food packs dropped by a plane for Filipino navy personnel at a territorial outpost that has been surrounded by Chinese vessels in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.\n\nGen Romeo Brawner said the Chinese personnel may have suspected the packages contained construction materials intended to reinforce a rusty Philippine navy ship ran aground at Second Thomas Shoal to serve as a Philippine outpost. After discovering the package contained food, they dumped the items, which included rice and biscuits, into the sea, Brawner said.\n\nAlso Read | Cybersecurity Attack: 81% Organisations Globally Paid Ransom To End Cyberattack and Recover Data for Third Year in Row, Says US-Based IT Firm Veeam.\n\nChinese officials did not immediately comment on Brawner's statement but they have repeatedly said the shoal, where the Philippine military deliberately grounded the navy ship in 1999, belonged to China and have demanded the ship be towed away. Operations to resupply Filipino forces at the grounded ship have led to skirmishes and collisions with Chinese coast guard ships that had damaged Philippine supply boats and injured several Filipino navy personnel.\n\nThe May 19 airdrops at Second Thomas Shoal by the Philippine military sparked a race by the Chinese coast guard and Philippine navy personnel aboard small motorboats to retrieve the four packages. The Filipinos managed to retrieve three of the floating packages and the Chinese grabbed one, Brawner told reporters in a news conference.\n\nAlso Read | China Train Accident: Six Railway Workers Dead After Being Hit by Freight Train in Heilongjiang Province.\n\nAfter the Chinese personnel dumped the food items, the Filipino sailors managed to retrieve some at sea but the rice had been soaked wet and could no longer be eaten, he said.\n\n\"This action of confiscating our supplies is illegal,\" Brawner said. \"They have no right to take our supplies, which are actually food items and some medicines.\"\n\nVideo and pictures issued by the Philippine military showed at least four motorboats maneuvering dangerously close to each other as the occupants struggled to retrieve items floating at sea, including what appeared to be a white plate and food containers. The men could be heard in the video yelling at each other.\n\nThe Philippines says the shoal, which lies less than 200 nautical miles (370 km) from its coast, falls within its internationally recognized exclusive economic zone and often cites a 2016 international arbitration ruling that invalidated China's expansive claims in the South China Sea based on historical grounds.\n\nThe territorial disputes have strained relations and sparked fears the conflict could bring China and the United States, a longtime treaty ally of the Philippines, into a military confrontation. Washington lays no territorial claims to the busy seaway, a key global trade route, but has warned that it's obligated to defend the Philippines if Filipino forces, ships and aircraft come under an armed attack in the South China Sea.\n\nAside from China and the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan are also involved in the long-seething territorial disputes, which are regarded as a flashpoint in Asia and a delicate fault line in the longstanding US-China rivalry in the region.

        "title": "Turkey's Top Diplomat Visits China, Planning Stops in Uyghur Genocide Region",
        "body": "Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan began a trip to China on Monday and is expected to travel to occupied East Turkistan on Tuesday, where the Communist Party has been engaging in a genocide of Uyghur and other indigenous Muslim communities since at least 2017.\n\nFidan is not expected to condemn the genocide - although it targets Turkic peoples - and his visit has prompted alarm among Uyghur civil society groups. Fidan made clear in remarks alongside Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Monday that his priorities upon visiting Beijing were galvanizing support for Hamas against Israel and increasing trade volume between China and Turkey.\n\nThe Islamist regime of strongman Recep Tayyip Erdogan was once one of the most vocal governments opposed to the abuse of Uyghurs by the Chinese government, which escalated into ethnic cleansing and, ultimately, genocide under ethnic Han dictator Xi Jinping. Erdogan significantly muted his criticisms after Turkey joined China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a predatory infrastructure scheme, in 2015. His foreign policy following the Hamas atrocities against Israel on October 7 has been almost singularly focused on supporting Hamas, which Erdogan himself has insisted is not a terrorist organization.\n\nIn his remarks alongside Wang Yi, Foreign Minister Fidan called China's support for Hamas \"extremely important\" and emphasized the growth in trade between the two countries.\n\n\"The great vision put forward by the two political leaders constitutes an important basis for the institutionalization and deepening of the relationship between China and Türkiye in modern times,\" the Turkish state-run Anadolu news agency quoted Fidan as saying in a report on Tuesday.\n\n\"Fidan also said the economy constitutes an important pillar of the relations between the two countries, that the bilateral trade volume reached $48 billion in 2023,\" Anadolu Agency continued, \"and that China is Türkiye's first largest trade partner in Asia and the third-largest trade partner globally.\"\n\nAnadolu did not offer any indication that Fidan addressed the ongoing Uyghur genocide or advocated for the rights of Turkic people under Chinese communist rule. Instead, Fidan celebrated the two East Turkistani cities that he is reportedly planning on visiting this week, Kashgar and the regional capital Urumqi, as critical to linking China and Turkey.\n\n\"These cities also play a bridge role between China and the Turkish world as well as between China and the Islamic world. They are symbols of our historical friendship and neighborhood,\" Fidan added.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party first occupied the East Turkistan Republic, then a sovereign state, in 1949. It has for decades acted to repress local cultures and impose totalitarian communism. Under Xi Jinping, however, the Communist Party began a campaign that extensive evidence suggests is a genocide. Communist officials began imprisoning Uyghurs and other Turkic peoples in concentration camps since at least 2017, where they are subject to extreme abuse, torture, forced sterilization, slavery, and other horrors. As many as three million people were shepherded into concentration camps in East Turkistan at their peak.\n\nAs a result of widespread international outrage, China claimed to shut down its \"Vocational and Educational Training Centers,\" the Party's term for the concentration camps. A widely condemned 2022 United Nations report took China's claims that the camps stopped existing in 2019 at face value.\n\nIn reality, not only has the genocide continued, but evidence suggests that China has funneled many of its victims into slavery, openly selling slaves to suppliers for international corporations online.\n\nErdogan was once a vocal supporter of the Uyghur cause, accusing China of \"genocide\" as early as 2009. Erdogan's stance after joining the BRI changed dramatically. In 2020, Turkey signed an extradition treaty with China, endangering the estimated 50,000 Uyghurs living in Turkey, and has muted criticism of the genocide. When Erdogan last mentioned Uyghur issues on the international stage - at the United Nations General Assembly in September - he said only that Turkey has \"sensitivity\" regarding the Uyghur community.\n\n\"We emphasize at every opportunity that we respect China's territorial integrity and sovereignty,\" Erdogan asserted. \"However, we will continue to express our sensitivity regarding the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of Uyghur Turks, with whom we have strong historical and humanitarian ties.\"\n\nFidan expressed hope on Monday that Turkey would expand its trade relations with China despite the human rights implications of doing so.\n\n\"We brought up the issue of how we can make trade figures more balanced in all our meetings. I made practical suggestions such as removing restrictions on the import of Turkish agricultural products,\" Fidan told reporters. \"Tourism is another area in which we want to further develop our cooperation.\"\n\nChinese officials welcomed Fidan's positive disposition and expressed hope to cooperate with Turkey on \"security,\" potentially resulting in Turkish law enforcement cooperating with the repressors of East Turkistan. Politburo member Chen Wenqing, who also met with Fidan, told him Beijing \"is willing to work with Turkey to bring cooperation in the field of security to new heights continuously,\" according to Chinese state propaganda outlet the Global Times.\n\nThe Global Times also suggested \"the visit will boost the China-Turkey cooperation under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative,\" in which China offers predatory loans to poor countries to commit them to pricey infrastructure projects they cannot afford.\n\nMembers of the international Uyghur community expressed concern and dismay with Turkey's stance on the genocide.\n\nSalih Hudayar, the foreign minister of the East Turkistan Government in Exile, said in a statement on Monday that Fidan's visit \"poses a grave threat to East Turkistan and the Uyghurs.\"\n\n\"Fidan has committed to deepening security cooperation with Chen, who last week visited East Turkistan and called for the continuation of the Uyghur Genocide under the guise of 'counter-terrorism,'\" he observed. \"The international community must remain vigilant and hold both nations accountable for their actions.\"\n\n\"Türkiye hosts one of the largest Uyghur diaspora communities globally, with approximately 50,000 individuals who fled the oppressive regime in China. However, this community faces growing harassment and intimidation by CCP-established transnational networks,\" the World Uyghur Congress, an international Uyghur association, said in a press statement on Fidan's visit. \"These networks spy on Uyghurs, exploiting factors such as passport applications, financial struggles, and concerns for family in East Turkistan to coerce Uyghur individuals into serving as informants, remaining silent on the Uyghur genocide, or participating in pro-China propaganda efforts.\"",

        "body": "The Philippines is collaborating with the United States and Japan to keep the West Philippine Sea (WPS) free and safe amid the ongoing tensions between Filipino and Chinese maritime forces in the disputed waters.\n\nPhilippine Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Ronnie Gil Gavan, who attended the recent International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) Shangri-La Dialogue: 21st Asia Security Summit held in Singapore, called on the Japan Coast Guard (JCG) and the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to develop innovative strategies to address the imminent threat in the high seas, particularly China's assertion of authority over non-Chinese fishermen.\n\n\"We intend to deploy our ships further out, in coordination with other agencies, to enhance the protection of Filipino fishermen,\" said Admiral Gavan.\n\n\"I advocate for increased presence in the high seas. While we will play our part, we also rely on your support to uphold the rules-based order, a crucial role for Coast Guards,\" he added.\n\nAdmiral Gavan acknowledged PCG's limitations but believes it can contribute to providing a window for diplomatic efforts to safeguard freedom of navigation at South China Sea.\n\nSCS overlaps WPS.\n\nIn April, China announced its authority over the Spratly Islands and the Paracel Islands, designating them as part of its \"Nansha\" and \"Xisha\" districts under the administration of Sansha City, located on Hainan Island's southern tip.\n\nThe Philippine government, through the Department of Foreign Affairs, has consistently protested against China's establishment of Sansha City since 2012, rejecting its jurisdiction over Philippine territory and maritime zones in the WPS.\n\nRegarding support from Japan, the JCG commended the PCG's principled stance and proposed increasing personnel exchanges to strengthen cooperation in maritime law enforcement and upholding the rule of law.\n\nMeanwhile, the US Coast Guard pledged to deploy its North Pacific Coast Guard to assist the PCG in defending its sovereign rights in the WPS. This includes conducting additional training, devising dynamic tactics, and equipping ships to counter emerging threats on the high seas.",

        "body": "Click here to get Khmer Times Breaking News direct into your Telegram\n\nSenate President Hun Sen has urged the United States (US) not to include Cambodia in its geopolitical rivalry in the region and sought to restore military cooperation.\n\nMr Hun Sen said that \"The US should not place Cambodia in its strategic rivalry, and should not use Cambodia as a place to compete geopolitically with other superpowers, which Cambodia has pursued diplomatic policies with, based on international law.\"\n\nHis remarks were made yesterday, during a courtesy call on him at the Senate by US Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin Ill who was on a one-day visit to Cambodia.\n\n\"The US has provided assistance to Cambodia in the areas of economy and defence in the past, and in order to improve our relationship, the two countries must address obstacles as soon as possible and continue to expand cooperation more effectively,\" Mr Hun Sen noted.\n\n\"We have been cooperating with each other in the past through dialogue between the two countries' Ministries of Defence, including on mutual agreement and joint military exercises and that is what we must continue to work together on,\" he said.\n\nAustin's official one day visit to Cambodia was aimed at strengthening US relationships with allies and partners in support of a shared regional vision for peace, stability and conflict deterrence.\n\nMr Hun Sen said that both sides should make efforts to improve good relations and although this has been murky in the past, he considered that the ties between Cambodia and the United States are not too bad.\n\nHe blamed past controversial issues on a lack of trust between the two sides and said that it was now time to find ways to rebuild trust together.\n\nMr Hun Sen noted that previous misunderstandings were due to a lack of information and in-depth dialogue between the two sides.\n\nHe advocated face-to-face dialogues because by distancing each other regarding issues would lead to the loss of credible information.\n\nMr Hun Sen said one important priority issue for which dialogue should be initiated was in the field of national defence to ensure that there is no mutual suspicion and to rebuild trust between the two countries.\n\nIn response, Austin thanked Mr Hun Sen for the warm welcome and extended his condolences over the passing away of the Great Supreme Patriarch Venerable Tep Vong whose body was cremated on Monday. He also expressed his condolences over the loss of 20 Cambodian military officers during an explosion at a depot in Kampong Speu province.\n\nHe gave the assurance that the United States will work with the Cambodian government to improve relations between the two countries.\n\nAustin said it was an opportunity for the two countries to make adjustments to improve attitudes and improve relations.\n\n\"Even though we still have some problems, we can sit down and work together to improve relations for our countries,\" he said.\n\nThe two sides agreed to continue dialogues to find a new path in Cambodian-US relations for the future.\n\nAustin also expressed praise for Prime Minister Hun Manet's strong commitment to improve relations between the two countries in the field of defence.\n\nHe said the US will reopen admission for Cambodian students to study at the West Point Military Academy in the United States (from which Mr Hun Manet himself had previously graduated).\n\nAdmission to the academy had been closed to Cambodian students over political differences in 2017.\n\nAustin added there would be more exchanges of dialogue in the military, joint exercises on humanitarian relief work and disaster management, continued demining training and clearance of unexploded ordnance.\n\nHe emphasised the need to restart defence dialogue to resolve differences and build greater trust for the two countries' mutually beneficial future.\n\nThe two sides also exchanged views on the Russia-Ukraine war, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the South China Sea dispute.\n\nRegarding issues in the South China Sea, Mr Hun Sen said that in order to have peace and stability in the region, all parties concerned must strictly adhere to the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) agreement, the parties to the dispute must resolve it together.\n\nHe noted that Cambodia as ASEAN Chair in 2022, had pushed for the South China Sea Code of Conduct (COC) to be put into practice to ensure long-term security in the region.\n\nOn the issue of the war between Ukraine and Russia and the conflict in the Middle East, the two sides agreed that war could not end with the continued use of weapons and that a negotiated solution was needed.\n\nIn particular, both sides agreed that a two-state solution in the Middle East conflict would provide lasting peace for Israel and Palestine.\n\nAustin also paid a courtesy call on Mr Hun Manet at the Peace Palace yesterday.\n\nGovernment Spokesman Pen Bona said that during the discussions, Austin had said the United States will be ready to work closely with Cambodia to establish mechanisms to build better relations and cooperation.\n\nHe said Austin expressed his pleasure to work closely with the Kingdom, which will organise the upcoming US-ASEAN Defence Dialogue in 2024.\n\nAustin also praised the Cambodian Army's demining skills and was confident that the United States and Cambodia would continue to cooperate in the field of demining, Bona said.\n\nMr Hun Manet expressed his belief that the visit by the US Secretary of Defense will provide new opportunities to expand defence cooperation between the two countries, including the fight against terrorism, human trafficking and drug trafficking, he added.\n\n\"The two sides discussed and exchanged views on regional and international security and the need to participate in building peace, stability, unity and prosperity in the region and internationally which would mutually benefit both countries,\" Bona said.\n\n\"Samdech Hun Manet requested the United States to resume cooperation in areas such as the exchange of military students between the two countries and operations on military exercises between Cambodian and US troops,\" he added.\n\nPentagon Press Secretary Major General Pat Ryder said that apart from calling upon Mr Hun Sen and Mr Hun Manet, Austin had met separately with Minister of National Defence General Tea Seiha.\n\nHe also engaged with Cambodian alumni of US Professional Military Education (PME) programmes, as well as cadets from US military academies, including the US Air Force Academy who are visiting Cambodia for educational purposes.\n\n\"In their meetings, the (Cambodian and US sides) discussed opportunities to strengthen the US Cambodia bilateral defence relationship in support of regional peace and security, including through the resumption of military training exchanges on disaster assistance and United Nations Peacekeeping, training and exchanges on demining and unexploded ordnance clearance, and Cambodia's access to US-PME programmes,\" he said.\n\nThey also welcomed continued discussions about these issues between their respective defence establishments, he said.\n\nAustin's second trip to Cambodia as Secretary of Defense follows his November 2022 trip for the 9th ASEAN Defense Ministers' Meeting (ADMM)-Plus in Siem Reap province, Maj Gen Ryder noted.\n\nKin Phea, director-general of the International Relations Institute at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, said yesterday that Austin's visit could have a positive impact on bilateral relations between Cambodia and the United States. It is also a new opportunity for both sides to talk openly about their problems or concerns as well as strategic interests.\n\nHe believes that Cambodia has always wanted to establish relations and cooperation with all countries in the world.\n\n\"If the two countries want to strategically deepen relations, the two sides should exchange visits frequently, as historical relations between the two countries have rarely involved high-level exchanges,\" Phea added.",

        "body": "US Marines Corps MQ-9A Reaper Drones are now operating in the Philippines as the US continues to beef up its military presence in the country, USNI News reported on Monday.\n\nThe Reaper drones, which can be armed with powerful Hellfire missiles, have been operating out of the Philippines since the spring at the request of Manila as the two nations are increasing intelligence sharing.\n\nA spokesperson for the I Marine Expeditionary Force told USNI that the Marines Corps \"will employ unarmed MQ-9As to provide reconnaissance and surveillance in support of the development of intelligence sharing between the US and our Philippine allies.\"\n\nUS Reaper drones have been deployed to support the Philippines in the South China Sea, where tensions are soaring between Manila and Beijing over disputed rocks and reefs in the waters. The US is strongly backing the Philippines in the dispute and has even committed itself to intervene if the situation turns into a shooting war.\n\nWhenever there is an incident between Chinese and Philippines boats in the South China Sea, the US takes the opportunity to remind China that the US-Philippine Mutual Defense Treaty applies to attacks on Philippine boats in the disputed waters.\n\nAccording to USNI, US Reaper drones conducted five sorties over the South China Sea in March to support \"critical maritime domain awareness and overwatch of the Second Thomas Shoal,\" referring to a disputed reef that's been a major source of tensions between Manila and Beijing.\n\nThe Philippines has a World War II-era warship that's grounded on Second Thomas Shoal that it uses as a base of operations for the area. China often intercepts Philippine boats trying to resupply the ship, and sometimes the encounters end in collision or with Chinese vessels firing water cannons.",

        "title": "Philippines denies its troops pointed guns at Chinese coast guard personnel",
        "body": "The Philippines on Tuesday rejected Beijing's allegations that Filipino troops had pointed guns at Chinese coast guard personnel after they \"dangerously approached\" a military outpost in the disputed South China Sea.\n\nChina's state-run media on Sunday said that Filipino marines stationed on the BRP Sierra Madre, a World War II-era naval ship run aground on Second Thomas (Ayungin) Shoal, had aimed their weapons at rigid-hulled inflatable boats (RHIBs) deployed by a China Coast Guard ship on May 19.\n\nPhilippine military chief Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. disputed the account, saying the troops were armed but followed strict rules of engagement and had acted \"with the highest level of professionalism, restraint and discipline.\"\n\n\"We are denying that any of our soldiers pointed their guns deliberately ...\" Brawner said at a press briefing Tuesday. \"But we will not deny the fact that they were armed because the BRP Sierra Madre is a commissioned navy ship and therefore it is authorized to have weapons.\n\nBrawner was echoing comments he had made in an interview with GMA news program \"24 Oras\" a day earlier.\n\n\"We have that right because of the concept of self-defense. We have the right to defend ourselves from any armed attack or external attack,\" he said.\n\nManila deliberately ran the rusty ship aground in 1999 to serve as its military outpost at the shoal. Since then, it has had to dispatch ships and boats regularly to deliver fresh supplies to the military personnel onboard the BRP Sierra Madre.\n\nBrawner accused the China Coast Guard of deploying RHIBs to intercept supplies that were being air-dropped to the Philippine troops.\n\nThe Chinese RHIBs, Brawner said, came \"very, very close\" to the BRP Sierra Madre and from the point of view of troops on board \"posed a danger or a threat.\"\n\nThe Chinese coast guard seized one of the four bags - which were dropped and contained food and some medicine - and later scattered the supplies at sea, Brawner said.\n\n\"Such behavior is unacceptable and undermines efforts to maintain peace and stability in the region,\" Brawner said.\n\nThe incident adds to rising tensions in the South China Sea. China claims almost all of the mineral-rich waterway while dismissing competing claims from the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam and Taiwan.\n\nIn 2016, an international arbitration court ruled in favor of the Philippines, throwing out China's sweeping historical claims. Beijing has never accepted the decision.\n\nChina has occupied Scarborough Shoal, which lies within Manila's 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone, for more than a decade.\n\nLast week, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue defense forum in Singapore, hit out at China's \"assertive actions that aim to propagate excessive, baseless claims through force, intimidation and deception.\"\n\nThe China Embassy in Manila did not reply to requests for comment on Brawner's statement, but sought to debunk Marcos' speech in Singapore.\n\n\"China's territorial sovereignty over maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea are based on solid historical and legal grounds,\" the Chinese Embassy said on Monday, quoting a foreign ministry spokesperson.",

        "body": "HOUSE Speaker Martin Romualdez on Tuesday said China's \"aggressive behavior\" will not improve its relations with the Philippines, after reports surfaced that the China Coast Guard (CCG) seized and dumped food and supplies meant for Filipino soldiers on Ayungin (Second Thomas) Shoal.\n\n\"We bemoan what happened and hope they stop this kind of aggressive behavior because it doesn't improve relations,\" Romualdez said in Filipino.\n\n\"In fact, the West Philippine Sea shouldn't define our relations with China. There are many aspects to that relation but while this aggressive behavior continues, the situation just gets more tense and our relations worsen,\" he added.\n\nThis handout photo taken on May 19, 2024 and received on June 4, 2024 from the Armed Forces of the Philippines shows two Chinese rigid-hulled inflatable boats (left and right) maneuvering close to Philippine personnel on board their boats (second left and second right) near the Philippine outpost at the Second Thomas Shoal in disputed waters of the South China Sea.

JV Ejercito condemned the CCG and said China's \"lack of compassion\" was shown when they interfered with the evacuation of sick Filipino soldiers. \"These heartless actions put lives at risk and show a complete lack of care for people's well-being,\" he said. He said China \"must respect Philippine's maritime activities in the area and refrain from engaging in actions that escalate tensions and jeopardize peace and stability in the region.\"\n\nSenate President Francis Escudero, meanwhile, reaffirmed his strong belief in the power of peaceful resolution through dialogue. He emphasized that this approach is a viable solution and the key to resolving the territorial disputes in the WPS.\n\n\"Ultimately, the important thing is that we stand united in not giving up sovereignty over those islands and oceans. But I still firmly believe that the (conflict can be resolved) through dialogue and should not lead to a war between our country and China and other countries,\" the Senate chief said in Filipino as he congratulated President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on his speech in Singapore asserting the country's sovereignty in the WPS.",

        "body": "PRESIDENT Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has articulated distinctly the Philippines' commitment to peace while the odds of armed conflict in the disputed South China Sea appear high and rising.\n\nThe 66-year-old President nailed the hammer on the head when he said at the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore the world cannot afford any other future for the South China Sea save the one envisioned by the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations or ASEAN.\n\nThat vision remains, for now at least, a distant reality, but the President's declared commitment to addressing and managing difficult issues through dialogue and diplomacy cannot and must not be ignored.\n\nThere are today threats and illegal actions that continue to violate the sovereignty, the sovereign rights and jurisdiction of the Philippines within the West Philippine Sea.\n\nWhile the President did not mention any state in his keynote address, China's implacable resoluteness against the Philippines in the area has led to what some diplomatic and security analysts have described as a situation where war in the South China Sea seems more likely than at any other Indo-Pacific flash point like the Taiwan Strait or the Korean Peninsula.\n\nIt seems such unrelenting harassment is intended to test the alliance of Manila and Washington, both treaty allies under a Mutual Defense Pact signed in Washington on Aug. 30, 1951 by their representatives in Washington, DC.\n\nThe treaty has eight articles and requires both nations to support each other if another party attacks the Philippines or the United States.\n\nPresident Marcos was clear: \"Illegal, coercive, aggressive, and deceptive actions continue to violate our sovereignty, sovereign rights, and jurisdictions.\n\n\"Attempts to apply domestic laws and regulations beyond one's territory and jurisdiction violate international law, exacerbate tensions, and undermine regional peace and security.\"\n\nThe President's message was direct and uncomplicated: the integrity of our maritime zones and our sovereignty must be respected.\n\nThis is not only a legal right but a moral necessity. By adhering to international law, we can ensure the West Philippine Sea remains a sea of peace, stability, and prosperity.\n\nThe President added the Philippines will not yield in the face of ongoing issues in the maritime region, underlining \"As President, I have sworn to this solemn commitment from the very first day that I took office. I do not intend to yield. Filipinos do not yield.\"\n\nHe said the Philippines will remain compliant to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 2016 Arbitral Award that provided the country a strong foundation for the peaceful resolution and management of disputes in Philippine waters.\n\nManila's policy in the South China Sea is built upon these two touchstones, by which the Philippines will continue to work with ASEAN and China towards an effective and substantive code of conduct, one firmly anchored on UNCLOS.",

        "body": "MANILA >> Philippine troops stationed on a warship grounded on a disputed South China Sea shoal held on to their weapons after Chinese coast guard boats came very close to the ship but they did not point their guns at them, military officials said on Tuesday.\n\nArmed Forces of the Philippines Chief of Staff Romeo Brawner disputed an account by China's state CCTV of what transpired during a routine resupply mission for Filipino troops on May 19.\n\nCCTV had reported at least two Filipino personnel pointed guns in their coast guards' direction during the confrontation at the BRP Sierra Madre, the vessel Manila grounded on Second Thomas Shoal and turned into a garrison in 1999.\n\n\"It was just in preparation for self-defense in case something happens because they were very close,\" Brawner told a press conference, describing the actions of the China Coast Guard as \"provocative.\"\n\nMilitary officials said Chinese rigid hull inflatable boats came within five to 10 meters of the beached Sierra Madre, and seized some of the supplies that were air dropped for troops, actions they said were illegal and unacceptable.\n\n\"This was a cause of alarm. So our soldiers as a precautionary measure, held on to their firearms. It is part of the rules of engagement,\" Brawner said.\n\n\"We are denying that any of our soldiers pointed deliberately their guns at any of the Chinese ... But we will not deny the fact that they were armed.\"\n\nBrawner said the Sierra Madre, a Second World War-era warship purposely grounded on the reef, is a commissioned vessel of the Philippine navy so it is authorised to have weapons.\n\n\"We have the right to defend ourselves,\" Brawner said, adding the Philippines would continue to assert its sovereignty in the area.\n\nChina claims almost the entire South China Sea, which includes the Second Thomas Shoal. It has deployed hundreds of vessels to patrol the waterway, including what Manila refers to as \"Chinese maritime militia,\" which it said were also present on May 19.\n\nChina's foreign ministry said the Philippines' actions at the shoal, which it calls Renai Reef, were illegal.\n\n\"On this issue the Philippines is the one who makes frequent infringements and provocations,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a briefing on Tuesday.\n\n\"The Philippines sending vessels to Ren'ai is in itself illegal, the Philippines is escalating the situation and we cannot accept it.\"",

On this issue, it is the Philippines who has repeatedly infringed on China's rights, made provocations and heightened tensions. We ask the Philippines to stop going back on its word and stop its provocations,\" said Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning.\n\nMao aired the accusation in a press conference after she was asked about China's previous allegation that Filipino personnel pointed guns at China Coast Guard.\n\nREAD: West Philippine Sea: AFP denies soldiers pointed guns at CCG\n\nIn the same press conference, Mao was asked to categorically state whether or not Philippine personnel truly pointed guns at the Chinese Coast Guard, but she did not provide a concrete answer on the matter.\n\nInstead, Mao opted to claim that the Philippines' grounding of BRP Sierra Madre in Ayungin Shoal is illegal.\n\n\"Since then, the Philippine side has further made frequent provocations, heightened tensions and escalated the situation. We find that simply unacceptable. China has more than once made clear its principled position on how this issue should be handled. We ask the Philippines to stop making provocations, and return to the right track of handling differences through dialogue and consultation,\" she said.\n\nThe China Coast Guard has been accused of seizing food and other supplies meant for Filipino troops at BRP Sierra Madre in Ayungin. Reports likewise claim that China allegedly obstructed a medical evacuation of ailing soldiers.\n\nBoth incidents took place on May 19, when the Philippine Navy performed an airdrop operation to bring the items to the BRP Sierra Madre.\n\nEarlier, the Armed Forces of the Philippines likewise denied China's claims involving alleged Filipino soldiers who pointed guns at their Coast Guard personnel.",

Operations to resupply Filipino forces at the grounded ship have led to skirmishes and collisions with Chinese coast guard ships that had damaged Philippine supply boats and injured several Filipino navy personnel.\n\nThe May 19 airdrops at Second Thomas Shoal by the Philippine military sparked a race by the Chinese coast guard and Philippine navy personnel aboard small motorboats to retrieve the four packages. The Filipinos managed to retrieve three of the floating packages and the Chinese grabbed one, Brawner told reporters in a news conference.\n\nAfter the Chinese personnel dumped the food items, the Filipino sailors managed to retrieve some at sea but the rice had been soaked wet and could no longer be eaten, he said.\n\n\"This action of confiscating our supplies is illegal,\" Brawner said. \"They have no right to take our supplies, which are actually food items and some medicines.\"\n\nVideo and pictures issued by the Philippine military showed at least four motorboats maneuvering dangerously close to each other as the occupants struggled to retrieve items floating at sea, including what appeared to be a white plate and food containers. The men could be heard in the video yelling at each other.\n\nThe Philippines says the shoal, which lies less than 200 nautical miles (370 kilometers) from its coast, falls within its internationally recognized exclusive economic zone and often cites a 2016 international arbitration ruling that invalidated China's expansive claims in the South China Sea based on historical grounds.\n\nThe territorial disputes have strained relations and sparked fears the conflict could bring China and the United States, a longtime treaty ally of the Philippines, into a military confrontation. Washington lays no territorial claims to the busy seaway, a key global trade route, but has warned that it's obligated to defend the Philippines if Filipino forces, ships and aircraft come under an armed attack in the South China Sea.\n\nAside from China and the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan are also involved in the long-seething territorial disputes, which are regarded as a flashpoint in Asia and a delicate fault line in the longstanding U.S.-China rivalry in the region.",

        "body": "Cambodia and the US will restore relations, restart military exercise, and accept Cambodian military students to study at West Point, according to a Facebook post by senate president Hun Sen who met US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Tuesday morning.\n\nOn his Facebook page, Hun Sen said Austin confirmed this during his visit, bringing the message from the US that they \"will work together with Samdech Techo [Hun Sen] and the Royal Government of Cambodia to restore and improve relations between the two countries\".\n\n\"The two countries can change [our] attitude to improve our relations, although we have different views on some issues. But our cooperation in many sectors [has been] fruitful and we can sit down to work together for fruitful results,\" Hun Sen said, quoting Austin.\n\nAustin has agreed to continue dialogues, notably on defense policy, to find a new path for the Cambodia-US relations in future.\n\nHe also mentioned that the US will reopen enrollment for Cambodians to study at the West Point military academy, participate in exchange programs in the joint military exercise as preparations for disaster relief, and continue training in demining landmines, Hun Sen said.\n\nIn 2021, the US canceled the scholarship for Cambodians to enroll in the West Point military on the basis that Cambodia had \"lost its eligibility for the military academy program due to weak cooperation in several areas of traditional bilateral military engagement\".\n\nHun Sen responded by agreeing with the US Defense Secretary's intention to enhance good relations.\n\n\"[I] consider the special relationship between our countries as not too bad [now] compared to the past. Previously, both sides lacked mutual trust, so we needed to find ways to build more trust. We have to manage different views, narrow differences, even if it is difficult,\" Hun Sen wrote.\n\n\"Another issue was the lack of information, and misjudgment, which confused both parties [as there was] no exchange of information and discussion,\" he continued.\n\nHun Sen called on the US government and other powerful nations not to pull Cambodia into its geopolitical conflict or \"use it as a battlefield\".\n\nHe reiterated that Cambodia has implemented an independent policy based on the law which does not take sides, and considers all countries as friends.\n\nFollowing his meeting with Hun Sen, Austin met Prime Minister Hun Manet where they discussed strengthening relations and cooperation with Cambodia in various sectors, particularly in the defense sector.\n\n\"The US is ready to work closely with Cambodia to implement a mechanism to build better relations and cooperation,\" Hun Manet wrote on Facebook page.\n\n\"The National Defense Minister and I also discussed mechanisms for re-cooperation [with the US] on some sectors as well as exchange of military students between our countries and joint military exercises with the US,\" Hun Manet said.\n\nIn an email response to CamboJA News, US embassy public diplomacy officer Wesley Holzer said this was the first bilateral visit by a US Secretary of Defense. However, it is a second visit to Cambodia for Austin who attended the ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting-Plus in Siem Reap in November 2022.\n\nAccording to a statement read out by Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder, Austin discussed opportunities to strengthen bilateral defense relationships in support of regional peace and security with Cambodia. This would be via \"the resumption of military training exchanges on disaster assistance and United Nations Peacekeeping, training and exchanges on demining and unexploded ordnance clearance, and Cambodia's access to US professional military education programs\".\n\nAustin, who arrived in Cambodia after attending the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, is expected to meet with his counterparts in the Indo-Pacific region as well as Admiral Dong Jun, his Chinese counterpart.\n\nHe will conclude his trip in France, where he will mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day, according to the U.S Defense Department.\n\nAustin later tweeted on X that he met with Hun Manet, a fellow West Point graduate. \"We discussed how the US and Cambodia can strengthen our defense relationship in support of regional peace and stability,\" he wrote.\n\nSeparately, an interview by Cambodia-China Radio with National Defense Minister Tea Seiha was posted by the Chinese embassy in Cambodia on May 28. In the interview, he thanked the Chinese government for the opportunity where both armies exchanged skills and acquired new skills and modernized weaponry in the recently concluded annual Golden Dragon military exercise.\n\n\"The [military] exercise was a demonstration of the relationship, especially showcasing the skills and experience of the Chinese People's Liberation Army which was transferred to the Cambodian army to understand better and increase its operation levels,\" Seiha said.\n\nHe added that Cambodia \"warmly welcomed Chinese ships docked at Preah Sihanouk Autonomous Port\" for the Golden Dragon military drill.\n\nIn the four-minute video clip, he also raised the South China Sea dispute, where he claimed that China was also \"trying to protect what belongs to China\". \"There is nothing we can't resolve if those countries try to meet and lay the problems on the table to discuss and find a solution,\" Seiha said.\n\nIn recent years, Cambodia-US relations have somewhat weakened after Cambodia suspended a joint military drill with the US in 2017. This was further compounded by concerns arising from 2019 that the Ream naval base would grant China's military exclusive access to a part of the base, situated on the Gulf of Thailand.\n\nHowever, both Cambodia and China have repeatedly denied the US' claims.\n\nThe Ream naval base previously featured US-funded installations, which were demolished in 2020. In 2022, the US Department of State urged Cambodia to be \"fully transparent\" about \"present and future Chinese activities at the Ream naval base\".\n\nMeanwhile, political analyst Meas Nee said the US was concerned about China's influence in relation to the Ream naval base and the presence of the Chinese army.\n\n\"All these can affect the economy and diplomacy if the situation remains unclear on both sides. We say it's not [Chinese army] but we have conducted military exercises with China, and we refused to do it with the US,\" Nee said.\n\nBut, he said, the US is keen on keeping diplomatic relations with Cambodia for the sake of strengthening regional security and stability.\n\nGovernment spokesperson Pen Bona declined to comment further, urging the reporter to refer to the government statement via social media.\n\nNational Defense Ministry spokesperson Chhum Socheat did not respond to questions.",

Even the three questions propounded to him, he answered it very well, he was not combative,\" Estrada said.\n\n\"Kasi may isang Chinese official na nagtanong, siyempre medyo palaban yung tanong (There was this Chinese official who asked, and the question was very critical) and the President answered it calmly, hindi siya combative,\" he added.\n\nLatest WPS issue\n\nRegarding the maritime disputes in the West Philippine Sea, he said that China's bullying is growing more severe and but filing a diplomatic protest is the Philippines' only remaining option instead of plunging into a war with China.\n\nGeneral Romeo Brawner Jr., Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) recently disclosed that China Cost Guard (CCG) personnel came as close as five to 10 meters from BRP Sierra Madre, a grounded Philippine Navy (PN) vessel which serves as an AFP outpost in the contested Ayungin Shoal, to seize one of the four food packages meant for the troops during a resupply mission.\n\nThe resupply mission was held on May 19 via airdrop method. After finding out that the packages contained food, the CCG threw it back into the water.\n\nPrior to the confrontation, Brawner said the CCG also blocked a medical evacuation (medevac) of a Fiipino trooper who fell ill while onboard BRP Sierra Madre.\n\n\"For me that is totally unacceptable,\" Estrada said.\n\nIn a statement, he called it a \"callous act\" that must be met with the utmost condemnation by the government and the international community.\n\n\"As I call upon our government to continue asserting our sovereignty and safeguard the welfare of our soldiers stationed at the Ayungin Shoal, I urge our international allies to stand with the Philippines in condemning in the strongest terms the recent actions of the China Coast Guard in the West Philippine Sea,\" he said.\n\nEstrada mentioned that the Philippines has consistently sought peaceful and diplomatic means to address the territorial disputes and uphold the rule of law. The reported seizure and dumping overboard of food and other supplies meant for our troops as well as the purported obstruction of a medical evacuation operation for ailing Filipino soldiers are \"callous acts\" that should not be tolerated.\n\n\"We should pursue all necessary measures to demand accountability for the latest acts by the CCG. Our soldiers deserve our unwavering support. Their bravery, dedication, and sacrifices should not be in vain and we must ensure that justice prevails,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Francis Tolentino echoed Estrada's statement, saying that a diplomatic protest must be filed.\n\nHe also said that China is doing these actions out of desperation following the success of President Marcos' participation in the Shangri-La Dialogue.\n\n\"Nakikita yung desperateness nila (China) ngayon dahil maliwanag na talagang viniviolate nila ang lahat ng umiiral batas pandaigdigan (We can see how desperate China is right now because they are clearly violating all international laws in place),\" he said.\n\nEven the President himself believes that China is \"punishing\" the Philippines through their recent aggressive actions in the WPS due to his speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore.\n\nTolentino believes that what China did is indeed a form of provocation.",

        "title": "Philippines denies soldiers pointed guns at China coast guard",
        "body": "The Philippines on Tuesday rejected Chinese allegations that its soldiers had pointed guns at a China Coast Guard vessel after it \"dangerously approached\" a military outpost in the disputed South China Sea.\n\nChina's state-run media on Sunday said that Filipino troops stationed on the BRP Sierra Madre, a World War II-era naval ship run aground on Second Thomas (Ayungin) Shoal, had aimed their weapons at the Chinese boats on May 19.\n\nPhilippine military chief Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. disputed the account, saying the troops were armed but followed strict rules of engagement and always acted \"with the highest level of professionalism, restraint and discipline.\"\n\n\"We are denying that any of our soldiers pointed their guns deliberately ...\" Brawner said at a press briefing Tuesday. \"But we will not deny the fact that they were armed because the BRP Sierra Madre is a commissioned navy ship and therefore it is authorized to have weapons.\n\n\"We have that right because of the concept of self-defense. We have the right to defend ourselves from any armed attack or external attack,\" he said.\n\nManila deliberately ran the rusty, old BRP Sierra Madre aground in 1999 to serve as its outpost at the shoal and has to dispatch ships on a regular basis to deliver fresh supplies to military personnel there.\n\nBrawner accused the China Coast Guard of deploying rigid hulled inflatable boats (RHIBs) to intercept supplies that were being air-dropped to the troops.\n\nThe Chinese RHIBs, Brawner said, came \"very, very close\" to the BRP Sierra Madre and from the point of view of soldiers on board \"posed a danger or a threat.\"\n\nThe Chinese coast guard seized one of the four bags that were dropped, which contained food and some medicine, and later scattered the supplies at sea, he said.\n\n\"Such behavior is unacceptable and undermines efforts to maintain peace and stability in the region,\" Brawner said.\n\nThe incident adds to rising tensions in the South China Sea. China claims almost all of the mineral-rich waterway while dismissing competing claims from the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam and Taiwan.\n\nIn 2016, an international arbitration court ruled in favor of the Philippines, throwing out China's sweeping historical claims. Beijing has never accepted the decision.\n\nChina has occupied Scarborough Shoal, which lies within Manila's 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone, for more than a decade.\n\nLast week, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue defense forum hit out at China's \"assertive actions that aim to propagate excessive, baseless claims through force, intimidation and deception.\"\n\nThe China Embassy in Manila did not reply to requests for comment on Brawner's statement, but sought to debunk Marcos' speech in Singapore.\n\n\"China's territorial sovereignty over maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea are based on solid historical and legal grounds,\" the Chinese Embassy said on Monday, quoting a foreign ministry spokesperson.",

From the point of view of our soldiers, this pose a danger, a threat dahil napakalapit na nila (because they were so close),\" AFP chief General Romeo Brawner Jr. said.\n\nThe Philippine Navy, meanwhile, presented a video to debunk the claim of Chinese state media that Filipino troops pointed guns at the Chinese agents on May 19, which the Philippine military denied.\n\n\"That is why there were videos, images of our soldiers carrying their guns but they, again I'd like to emphasize, they did not point their guns to the Chinese. Meron po tayong sinusunod na rules of engagement. Alam po ng mga sundalo natin yan,\" he added.\n\n(We are following a rule of engagement. The soldiers know that.)\n\nBased on the video provided by the Philippine Navy, the Chinese agents went five to 10 meters close to BRP Sierra Madre when the second of the four batches of supplies dropped in the area.\n\nThe Chinese agents, who are possibly from the China Coast Guard or People's Liberation Army, used two rigid hull inflatable boats while Filipino personnel used two rubber boats to pick up the supplies.\n\nWhile they were racing for the supplies, a Filipino personnel can be heard in the video saying that one of the Chinese agents fell off their boat.\n\n\"Unfortunately one of the packages was intercepted by the Chinese,\" Brawner said.\n\n\"As you saw in the video when the second package resupply package was dropped, they went to the area to recover it despite the fact that our boats were already there so nakipagagawan pa sila, inunahan pa tayo (they were trying to get it first.),\" he added.\n\nChina claims almost the entire South China Sea, including parts claimed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei.\n\nThe section of the sea that is within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone was renamed the West Philippine Sea.\n\nIn 2016, an international arbitration tribunal in the Hague said China's claims had no legal basis.

        "title": "Ukrainian president berates China at Singapore security conference",
        "body": "facebook icon\n\nThe unannounced appearance of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the annual Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore last weekend is another sign of the global character of the US-NATO war against Russia in Ukraine.\n\nZelensky exploited the opportunity to lash out at China for failing to line up against Russia as he sought support at Asia's premier security forum for Ukraine's so-called peace conference to be held in Switzerland later this month.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference, the Ukrainian president accused Russia of using Chinese diplomats to pressure governments not to attend the Swiss gathering. Zelensky, who heads the US-backed puppet regime in Kyiv, declared: \"It is unfortunate that such a big independent powerful country as China is an instrument in the hands of Putin.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian-sponsored \"peace conference\" is nothing more than a propaganda exercise for the Zelensky regime and its imperialist backers. The Ukrainian president explained that the forum will revolve around a discussion of points of his \"peace plan\" which amount to a demand for Russia's capitulation.\n\nThe meeting in Switzerland will take place as the US has dramatically escalated the conflict by giving the green light to Ukraine to use American long-range missiles to strike into Russian territory greatly heightening the danger of nuclear war. That is the real character of the \"peace\" that will be discussed.\n\nChina stated last week that it would not send a delegation to the summit, insisting that a genuine peace conference should have \"recognition by both Russia and Ukraine, equal participation by all parties, and fair discussion of all peace plans.\"\n\nZelensky also parroted Washington's claims that China is selling \"dual use\" items to Russia enabling it to maintain its military capabilities. Certain elements that make up parts of Russia's weaponry, he said, \"come from China.\"\n\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin mouthed the same accusation in a meeting with his Chinese counterpart Dong Jun, warning that there would be \"consequences\" for any Chinese support for Russia's military. Washington is planning another round of punitive sanctions on China over the export of \"dual use\" items to Russia.\n\nWhat staggering hypocrisy! As the Biden administration supplies tens of billions worth of actual weaponry to Ukraine to attack Russian forces, it demands that China halt trade in so-called \"dual use\" items -- an ill-defined category covering a vast array of goods.\n\nIn fact, US imperialism is seeking to bully China into assisting in the economic crippling of Russia. Washington had calculated that its far-reaching sanctions on Russia -- including a freeze on its foreign currency reserves of $350 billion and exclusion from the SWIFT system for facilitating international transactions -- would bring Moscow to its knees.\n\nUS objections are not just to \"dual use\" items but that the growth of overall Chinese trade has provided an economic lifeline to Russia. Estimates cited in the US-based Foreign Affairs journal indicate bilateral trade grew by 36 percent to $190 billion in 2022 and further expanded to $240 billion last year. The bulk of China's imports from Russia were oil, gas and coal, while Chinese exports were dominated by industrial equipment, cars and consumer electronics.\n\nChinese Defence Minister Dong denied US allegations that Beijing was bolstering Russia's defence industries with dual-use exports. He pointed out that China had not provided weapons to either side of the conflict and had put stricter controls on the export of dual-use items.\n\nSpeaking on Monday, China's foreign ministry spokesperson defended China's trade with Russia. \"We also attach great importance to our relations with Ukraine... China and Ukraine have maintained communication and cooperation since the Ukrainian crisis escalated,\" Mao Ning said.\n\nEven as it is waging war against Russia in Ukraine and backing Israel's genocide in Gaza, US imperialism is accelerating its military build-up throughout the Indo-Pacific against China, which Washington regards as the chief threat to its global dominance.\n\nUS Defense Secretary Austin boasted to the gathering about the \"new era of security\" in the Indo-Pacific as the US strengthens military alliances and partnerships in the region such as AUKUS -- with Australia and the UK -- and the \"Quad\" -- with Japan, India and Australia. This \"new convergence\" outlined by Austin is accompanied by an expansion of joint war games aimed at rehearsing for conflict with China.\n\nThat the US build-up of \"collective capacity\" is aimed against China was evident in the comments by two close US allies to the Singapore summit -- Australia and the Philippines. Both lashed out against China's activities in the South China and East China Seas.\n\nIn a deliberately provocative speech, Australian Defence Minister Richard Marles blamed China not only for recent confrontations with Australian naval forces, but also condemned its purported aggressive actions towards the Philippines and Taiwan.\n\n\"Actions by Chinese vessels in the West Philippine Sea [the Philippine term for the East China Sea], such as the use of water cannons and the ramming of Philippine vessels, are a serious escalation of tensions,\" he declared, adding that \"China's behaviour towards Taiwan creates similar concerns.\"\n\nThe US and its allies, particularly the Philippines, have deliberately heightened tensions with China over longstanding territorial disputes in the South China Sea. In the case of Taiwan, the Biden administration has effectively overturned the \"One China\" policy by boosting relations and arms sales to Taipei. It also has put US military \"trainers\" on the island.\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr also indirectly condemned China's actions declaring that he would not allow the country to yield one square inch or even a millimetre of its territory and maritime zones. While claiming to want to resolve issues through \"dialogue and diplomacy,\" the Marcos administration has greatly enhanced the US military presence in the country and involvement in joint drills.\n\nAustin also joined the fray declaring: \"Every country, large or small, has the right to enjoy its own maritime resources. The harassment the Philippines has faced is dangerous, pure and simple.\"\n\nChinese Defence Minister Dong responded on Sunday condemning the formation of \"exclusive military alliances\" and attempts to create \"bloc confrontation.\" He continued: \"Various small circles targeting other countries cannot make our region safer and can only cause more tension.\"\n\nDong accused Washington of \"hegemonic behaviour,\" declaring that the \"relevant countries should abandon their zero-sum mindset, arrogance and bias and treat regional countries with sincerity.\" Without mentioning the US, he accused the Philippines of being emboldened by outside powers to break bilateral agreements [with China] and make premeditated provocations.\n\nThe defence minister declared that \"China has exercised great restraint,\" but warned that \"there is a limit to our restraint.\" In particular, he condemned Manila's decision to allow the US to station mid-range missiles in the region for the first time since the Cold War.\n\nThe exchanges between Chinese officials and those from the US and its allies have been escalating over the past decade as Washington has ramped up its confrontation with Beijing. The presence of Zelensky, however, condemning China and touting for support for the war against Russia is a sharp warning the brutal war that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives already is rapidly developing into a wider conflict not just in Europe, but in Asia and throughout the world.\n\nRead moreStop the US-NATO escalation toward nuclear war!

        "title": "Analysis: China and Trump loomed large at Singaporean defense summit",
        "body": "Any tourist wandering through the glitzy lobby of Singapore's Shangri-La Hotel this weekend would have stumbled on a rather bizarre scene.\n\nMilitary officers from around the world thronged the halls of the luxury hotel, their shoulders dripping with gold braids and epaulets, complicated colored bars lined up on the chests of their dress uniforms like some martial game of Tetris.\n\nEvery few minutes a defense minister strode purposely through the mix, surrounded by a phalanx of aides and escorts.\n\nThis gathering is an annual spectacle that to the uninitiated might seem surreal. But the topics being discussed here are deadly serious.\n\nThe annual Shangri-La Dialogue is one of the few places in the world where you can watch warriors who spend their careers preparing for armed conflict, engaged in polite, carefully-moderated debate.\n\nThe stakes this year could hardly be higher.\n\nWar rages in both the Middle East and Europe. Meanwhile China's increasingly assertive moves has much of the Asia-Pacific on edge.\n\nThe Singapore summit brought key players together.\n\nWhere else would you have the President of the Philippines, a nation whichdo has seen its vessels increasingly targeted by Chinese coast guard ships in the disputed South China Sea, deliver a keynote address on the same stage that, two days later, Beijing's new Defense Minister makes his debut appearance?\n\nThere was even a surprise appearance from Ukraine's embattled president Volodymyr Zelensky - and a first face-to-face meeting between US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Chinese counterpart Adm Dong Jun.\n\nGiven its location in the city-state of Singapore, events in Asia - and in particular China's behavior in the region - stalked the conference.\n\nIn his keynote speech, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. issued a stark warning about the ongoing confrontations between Philippine and China Coast Guard vessels in a contested part of the South China Sea.\n\n\"If a Filipino citizen is killed by a willful act,\" he said, \"that is I think, very, very close to what we define as an act of war.\"\n\nTwo days later, China's Adm Dong fired back from the same stage, accusing the Philippines of \"blackmail\" in the maritime dispute.\n\n\"There is a limit to our restraint,\" said Admiral Dong Jun.\n\n\"I saw that as a threat,\" said Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a research professor at Indonesia's National Research and Innovation Center who has been attending the Shangri-La Dialogue since its founding twenty-one years ago.\n\n\"In decades past, the Chinese only came in a small number and they were extremely quiet,\" she said. \"Now they're very self confident...they intervene in all the sessions.\"\n\nThe open nature of the Shangri-La Dialogue provides delegates with a unique opportunity to ask blunt questions of speakers.\n\nAfter his speech on Sunday, China's Dong received many questions from audience members on Beijing's increased threats towards self-governing Taiwan as well as its disputed claims in the South China Sea, and he replied in unapologetic terms.\n\nThe \"separatists\" in Taiwan's newly-elected government would be \"nailed to the pillar of shame in history,\" he said.\n\nBut equally, Chinese military officers also used Q&A sessions at other key moments to make their views known.\n\nSenior Colonel Yanzhong Cao of China's People's Liberation Army asked US Secretary of Defense asked US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin whether the US was trying to build a NATO-like alliance in the Asia-Pacific region, adding the claim \"the eastward expansion of NATO has led to the Ukraine crisis.\"\n\n\"I respectfully disagree,\" Austin replied, the audience in the ballroom then erupting into a rare burst of applause.\n\n\"The Ukraine crisis obviously was caused because Mr. Putin made a decision to unlawfully invade his neighbor,\" Austin continued. \"This was brought on because of a decision by Mr. Putin.\"\n\nLater that day, Ukrainian leader Zelensky got a borderline rock star welcome when he made a surprise appearance at the conference, dressed in his trademark fatigues and black t-shirt.\n\n\"We stand with you,\" Ng Eng Hen, Singapore's minister of defense, later said to Zelensky.\n\nBut the large contingent of Chinese army officers present at other sessions was notably absent during Zelensky's speech and the Ukrainian leader said he failed to secure a one-on-one meeting with Chinese officials during his Singapore visit.\n\nHe also accused Beijing of aiding Ukraine's mortal enemy.\n\n\"With China's support to Russia, the war will last longer. That is bad for the whole world, and the policy of China - who declares that it supports territorial integrity and sovereignty and declares it officially. For them it is not good,\" Zelensky told journalists.\n\nIt was not clear whether Zelensky succeeded in securing new support for Kyiv from non-aligned south-east Asian countries like Malaysia and Indonesia.\n\nInstead, Indonesian president-elect and retired general Prabowo Subianto - the new leader of the world's most populous Muslim majority nation - spent much of his speech calling for an end to the on-going carnage in Gaza and an investigation into recent Israeli attacks that killed dozens of displaced civilians in Rafah.\n\nAnother political elephant in the room was what direction might the United States be heading in.\n\nThe Singapore gathering began just hours after a 12-person jury in a court-room in New York City convicted former US President Donald Trump on of all 34 counts of falsifying business records in his hush money criminal trial.\n\nAsia is watching very closely for whether Trump will return to office in November and what impact that might have on the world's most populous continent and a region already fraught with very real geopolitical fault lines.\n\nIn a sign of clear discomfort with the news, a US lawmaker Michael McCaul, Chairman from the House Foreign Affairs Committee, abruptly cancelled filming a previously scheduled interview with CNN.\n\nHis fellow Republican Senator Dan Sullivan also requested not to discuss Trump during a meeting with journalists, instead directing reporters to a press release.\n\n\"This is a very sad day for American and the rule of law,\" Sullivan's statement said, calling the verdict a \"gross abuse of our justice system.\"\n\nBut speaking to journalists, the Senator from Alaska also celebrated what he called America's \"commitment to liberty and democracy,\" saying this marked a competitive advantage over \"authoritarian aggression led by China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.\"\n\nSullivan was part of a bi-partisan delegation seeking to demonstrate Congressional commitment to US allies in Asia.\n\n\"The dictators we are allied against...are ally poor,\" Sullivan said.\n\nBut there are clearly concerns about US reliability.\n\nAn academic from Japan - Washington's closest ally in Asia - asked defense chiefs from Singapore and Malaysia about Trump's possible re-election. He called it a \"nightmare\" scenario.\n\nThat triggered nervous laughter from the audience and on stage.\n\nSingapore's Dr. Ng Eng Hen gamely responded, \"we will work with any administration in any country if we can find common ground.\"\n\nI vividly remember collective nervousness at the 2017 Shangri-La Dialogue, held just months after Trump's inauguration.\n\nTrump's then secretary of defense James Mattis clearly sought to reassure American defense partners worried about the new mercurial president.\n\n\"Bear with us,\" Mattis told the audience, after being asked whether the \"America First\" commander-in-chief would contribute to the destruction of the post-World War II order.\n\n\"Once we've exhausted all possible alternatives, the Americans will do the right thing. We will still be there.\"\n\nSeven years later, uncertainty over the political future of the US is just one of many challenges facing policy makers.\n\nOne by one, the leaders of armies and navies shared their fears about climate change, nuclear proliferation, wars in Europe and the Middle East and concerns that a miscalculation between the US and Chinese militaries could spiral out of control\n\n\"The world cannot withstand a third geopolitical shock,\" Singaporean defense chief Dr. Ng warned, after invoking the Gaza and Ukraine conflicts.\n\nIn this tense geopolitical environment, it's far better for commanders to put on their dress uniforms and rub shoulders in the halls of a five-star hotel, than aim at each other over gun barrels on the battlefield.",

        "title": "Malaysia urged to get tougher with Beijing over South China Sea claims",
        "body": "Toshi Yoshihara, an American expert on China’s military, called for Malaysia to reject Beijing’s ‘excessive claims’ over the disputed waters\n\nPrioritising short-term trade benefits instead of addressing the territorial conflict could cost Malaysia dearly in the long run, he argues\n\nMalaysia should take a more proactive approach to defending its rights in the South China Sea, an American expert on China who has advised the Pentagon warned – urging the Southeast Asian nation to reject Beijing’s “excessive claims” over the disputed waters and protect its own long-term strategic goals.\n\nPrioritising short-term trade benefits poses serious risks that could ultimately result in greater long-term costs, said Toshi Yoshihara, a senior fellow at the Washington -based Centre for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments think tank who has written extensively on China’s military and maritime policy.\n\nHe said these costs could come in various forms, from economic penalties to loss of territorial integrity and increased regional instability, undermining Malaysia’s national interests and security.\n\n“Accommodating China is basically paying later with extra penalties, and frequently the penalty will come in the form of blood, sweat and tears,” Yoshihara told This Week in Asia on Monday, a day before he was expected to brief the National Defence University of Malaysia on the same topic.\n\nThe resource-rich waters of the South China Sea are claimed by Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines and Vietnam. China’s claims over the disputed waters, demarcated on Beijing’s maps by its “nine dash line”, crosses into all of these countries’ exclusive economic zones.\n\nAlthough the boundaries of exclusive economic zones are upheld by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and a 2016 arbitral decision in The Hague, China has dismissed these international rulings in favour of what it claims to be its historical rights over the region.\n\nChina has repeatedly encroached into the waters of Malaysia’s exclusive economic zone, particularly around Sabah and Sarawak. These incursions, often involving Chinese coastguard ships, have intensified in recent years following the discovery of significant oil and gas reserves.\n\nYoshihara’s comments came in response to remarks made last month by former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, which were widely interpreted as a call to let China’s claims over the disputed waters go unchallenged.\n\n“They [China’s government] claims that the South China Sea belongs to them, but they have not stopped ships from passing through,” Mahathir said at the Nikkei Future of Asia conference in Tokyo last month.\n\n“As long as there is no stoppage of the passage of ships through the South China Sea, then it’s good enough.”\n\nWith Malaysia’s economy heavily reliant on trade from both the United States and China, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has been accused of playing down Chinese vessels’ encroachments into Malaysian waters, asserting that his country has no issues with Beijing.\n\nSpeaking in Melbourne at the Asean-Australia summit in March, Anwar said Western nations were trying to dictate Malaysia’s stance on China\n\n“If they have problems with China, they should not impose it upon us. We do not have a problem with China,” Anwar said.\n\nChina has been Malaysia’s largest trading partner for the past 15 years, currently accounting for some 17 per cent of the country’s total trade volume.\n\nYoshihara, author of the 2022 book Mao’s Army Goes to Sea, which details the founding of the Chinese navy and the start of Beijing’s maritime and island-building campaigns, suggested that Kuala Lumpur could learn from Manila about how to “deal with peacetime coercive intimidation tactics” in the South China Sea.\n\nManila’s tactics include documenting its maritime territorial conflicts with Beijing. He noted that the Philippine navy has been releasing footage of its clashes with the Chinese coastguard around the Second Thomas Shoal, which Yoshihara described as a “public relations disaster” for China.\n\nDuring several clashes, Chinese ships have shot high-pressure water cannons at Philippine forces, resulting in vessels being damaged and crewmen being injured.\n\n“The violent force of the water cannons suggested they can inflict casualties and perhaps even death. China is sort of struggling to deal with this new narrative,” Yoshihara said.\n\nAt the Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore on Friday, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr said the death of any of his citizens or servicemen would come very close to constituting “an act of war” – and vowed to respond accordingly.\n\n“Once we get to that point, certainly we would have crossed the Rubicon. Is that a red line? Almost certainly it’s going to be a red line,” Marcos Jnr said.\n\nIn response, China asserted its claims over the South China Sea and accused Manila of jeopardising the security and stability of the region through its close ties with the US, including the placement of mid-range missile systems in the Philippines as part of a joint military exercise in April.\n\n“China has exercised great restraints in the face of such infringements and provocations,” said Chinese Defence Minister Dong Jan at the forum.\n\nThe Philippines, a former US colony, signed a mutual defence treaty with Washington in 1951, dictating that both nations would support each other if either were attacked by an external party.",

        "body": "The United States has a strong interest in standing with its allies against Chinese expansionism.\n\nIn August 2013, US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel declared while in Manila that the US-Philippines alliance is \"an anchor for peace and stability\" in the region. In October of the same year, US Secretary of State John Kerry emphasized in Tokyo that the \"US-Japan alliance is the cornerstone of peace and prosperity in Asia Pacific.\" Notwithstanding these bold pronouncements from high-ranking US officials, some in America have expressed concerns over the possibility of entrapment in case the two US allies' separate disputes with China turn violent. Some are concerned that Washington could get dragged into a war with China over tiny islands that the US has no national interest in. Others argue that Washington's long-standing policy of strategic ambiguity should be applied on the East and South China Seas in order to deter the Chinese from changing the relevant status quos, and the Japanese and the Filipinos from getting too emboldened. These beg two important questions. First, will militarily defending Japan and the Philippines over their disputes with China really mean entrapment of the US? Second, will ambiguity in American security commitments to Tokyo and Manila result in an outcome in favor of peace and stability?\n\nRegarding the first question, it is important to dissect what the East and South China Sea disputes involve.\n\nOn the East China Sea dispute, it must be noted that it was only in 2008 when China started to send civilian law-enforcement vessels to the territorial waters of the islands in contention. In retrospect, this was the start of Beijing's attempt to revise the status quo of the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. Over the years, the frequency of incursions increased dramatically. Recently, such attempt to alter the status quo was extended to the relevant airspace with China sending paramilitary aircraft and declaring an air-defense identification zone. In 2010, Beijing used economic coercion to prevent Tokyo from sentencing a Chinese fishing trawler captain who deliberately rammed his ship into Japanese Coast Guard vessels. Furthermore, the Senkaku/Diaoyu dispute involves maritime boundary questions. This is significant because the East China Sea is an important sea lane, where energy and trade for South Korea and Japan pass through. It is also a strategic common that is the gateway to mainland East Asia and an immediate connection to the South China Sea, a very important choke point.\n\nOn China's dispute with the Philippines, it must be noted that Beijing's ambiguous \"nine-dash line\" claim effectively turns much of the South China Sea, including areas long considered part of the global commons, as China's own territorial waters. Given that $5.3 trillion worth of trade passes through the South China Sea every year, $1.2 trillion of which is US trade, the significance of the dispute between Manila and Beijing cannot be underestimated.\n\nBeijing has been using coercion and intimidation to change the status quo of the islands and maritime domains in the South China Sea. In 1995, Chinese forces occupied and built a garrison on the Mischief Reef, a submerged maritime feature located 129 nautical miles west of a major Philippine landmass and 599 nautical miles southeast of Hainan, the nearest Chinese landmass. Under customary international law and its codified version, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), submerged maritime features cannot be claimed by any state as a territory under its sovereignty. Hence, their control is dependent on whichever exclusive economic zone (EEZ) or continental shelf they are located. Moreover, in 2012, China also successfully flipped the status quo of the Scarborough Shoal, another maritime feature within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, after a tense standoff. Quite recently, China has been attempting to eject Manila's military presence in the Second Thomas Shoal, another submerged maritime feature within the Philippines' UNCLOS-mandated continental shelf. In March 2014, China twice implemented a blockade which tried to prevent the Philippine military from provisioning and rotating its troops in the shoal. Months prior to those incidents, China has been sending naval frigates and civilian maritime law enforcement vessels to contested waters in an apparent attempt to intimidate the Philippine government.\n\nAll of these reveal two issues. First, the disputes in the East and South China Seas involve a rising revisionist power trying to alter the status quo, not by the rule of law or peaceful, nonhostile means, but by intimidation and coercion. Second, the disputes involve not just the islands themselves, but maritime domains critical for the control of valuable trade routes and strategic commons.\n\nWhat then do these two issues mean for the United States? They mean that militarily defending Japan and the Philippines is not simply giving a favor to longstanding allies. It's not entrapment. Clearly committing to their defense means defending two important US national interests: 1) the rule of law, and 2) securing freedom of navigation and unimpeded lawful commerce in very strategic trade routes and critical choke points. These two alone are enough justifications for Washington to clearly stand by with its two Pacific allies.\n\nRegarding the second question, it is obvious that America's \"strategic ambiguity\" has not been effective in preserving East Asian status quo. Strategic ambiguity is not a wise answer to China's approach of \"salami slicing\" and \"talk-and-take\" policy in East Asian seas. China has shown that it is not interested in signing a binding code of conduct in the South China Sea nor in clarifying its claims to be in line with UNCLOS. While both Philippine president Benigno Aquino and Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe have been repeatedly stressing the importance of upholding the rule of law, Beijing has been continually rejecting multilateral platforms and international arbitration for resolving disputes. Recent incidents indicate that China is becoming more inclined to use intimidation, coercion and even force against its neighbors to attain its objectives.\n\nWith all these, Washington should be very specific with its security commitments to both Tokyo and Manila, before it's too late. If Japan doubts the security guarantee of its US alliance, the ramifications would be deleterious. Other American allies would consequently also doubt the US. Why? Because if the US could consider an abandonment of the world's third largest economy, what guarantee is there that Washington would not do the same to other allies? In a way, the US-Japan alliance is the ultimate measure of America's rebalance to Asia. Furthermore, doubts in the US-Philippines alliance are more likely to embolden China to use force since, unlike Tokyo, Manila has a weak military and a significantly lower deterrent capability.\n\nAmbiguity also increases miscalculation and could result in a vicious arms race. On the one hand, China might perceive the two US alliances as not very credible -- resulting in military adventurism. On the other hand, Japan and the Philippines might perceive the ambiguous US commitments to be too weak a security guarantee and so result in an overshoot of military buildup, increasing regional tensions further. Those are just a few possible consequences of US commitments being open to interpretation, in addition to others that can exacerbate the already tensed geopolitical and security landscape of the region.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is understandable for some to put an emphasis on America's economic relations with China, Washington should be clear with its treaty allies in the Pacific for reasons outlined above -- promoting the rule of law, preserving freedom of navigation and unimpeded lawful commerce, and protecting strategic global commons and critical chokepoints. These are indispensable and long-term US national interests. Being clear with its security commitments could drastically restrain China from further destabilizing revision of relevant status quos and deter it from using threat or force, while at the same time reducing the security uncertainties of US allies and smaller powers in East Asia. The US-Japan and the US-Philippines alliances, would then be the cornerstone and an anchor, respectively, of peace and stability in the region -- not an entanglement.",

I am pleased that the Philippines will participate in the summit,\" Zelenskyy posted via his official account on social media platform X.\n\nIt remains unclear for now if Marcos himself will attend the summit, or if a ranking official will be sent instead.\n\nThe two presidents were supposed to meet on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue at the weekend, but their schedules did not sync. Zelenskyy then flew to Manila early morning yesterday.\n\nIn his keynote address in Singapore, Marcos hit out at what he described as the \"illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive actions\" being taken in the disputed South China Sea, though he did not directly name Beijing.\n\nTensions have been boiling between Beijing and Manila during these past months, as the China Coast Guard has been firing water cannon on Philippine ships sending supplies to troops stationed at a remote outpost at a disputed shoal.\n\nZelenskyy, meanwhile, held a separate press briefing in Singapore and accused China of allegedly helping Russia thwart the peace summit in Switzerland.\n\nDuring their meeting, Marcos told Zelenskyy that the Philippines is looking forward to working together with Ukraine in forging peace.\n\nHe also welcomed Ukraine's plan to open an embassy in the Philippines later in 2024.\n\n\"That's certainly very good news because we would very much like to continue to help, in any way, that the Philippines can through multilateral (channels) and (the) United Nations, and even through other agencies such as the European Union,\" said Marcos.\n\nHe then reiterated the Philippines' support for Ukraine in its war against Russia.\n\n\"We will continue to do all that we can to promote peace and to bring an end to the fighting and to come to a political resolution of your country,\" Marcos said.\n\n\"I think everybody fully understands that it is easier said than done, and it will be a difficult road to find our way back to the situation that is morally acceptable not only to Ukraine, but to the rest of the world.\"\n\nIn November 2022, the Philippine leader had described Russia's invasion of Ukraine's territories as \"unacceptable\" and asked both nations to resolve the conflict in a diplomatic manner.\n\nThe Philippines also voted in favour of a UN General Assembly resolution condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nZelenskyy thanked Manila for its continued support.\n\n\"We're very thankful to be in here in your country which supports Ukraine, our territorial integrity and sovereignty.\n\n\"Thank you so much for your 'big word' and clear position about us, about this Russia occupation of our territories,\" he said. -- The Straits Times/ANN",

        "body": "MANILA, Philippines -- Senators on Monday spoke with one voice in condemning what they called the \"inhumane\" acts of the China Coast Guard (CCG) against Filipino soldiers at Ayungin (Second Thomas) Shoal in the West Philippine Sea.\n\nCiting a ranking military official, the Inquirer reported on Monday that the CCG seized food and other provisions for the soldiers posted at BRP Sierra Madre, soon after an airdrop operation at Ayungin on May 19 to bring those items to the grounded vessel which serves as the Philippines' military outpost at the shoal.\n\nBesides throwing the food supply at sea, the CCG was reported to have harassed an evacuation operation also that day for soldiers at Ayungin who were reported ill.\n\nREAD: China Coast Guard seizes PH supplies for Ayungin\n\n\"This is too much. It's inhumane!\" Sen. JV Ejercito told the Inquirer in a Viber message.\n\n\"These are already extreme hostilities being displayed by the Chinese government. We need to ask allies to come to our aid during this very sensitive situation,\" he said.\n\nCiting Geneva Conventions\n\nSen. Nancy Binay said the CCG brazenly flouted international treaties and protocols, including the humanitarian treatment of wounded and ailing soldiers under the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their Additional Protocols.\n\nThe American Red Cross issued a summary in 2011 explaining this set of international treaties as being applicable not only in armed conflicts, but also in instances of occupation by another nation's troops.\n\n\"These actions [by the China Coast Guard] show the outright disregard of the paramount principle of humane treatment and compassion and violate the protocols of the Geneva Conventions on the treatment of the wounded and sick,\" Binay said.\n\n\"The obstruction of medical aid to our personnel is an affront to these international norms and human dignity,\" she also said.\n\nThe Philippines is ready to bring these incidents to the attention of international bodies, including the United Nations, she added.\n\n\"We will continue to stand firm in our resolve to protect our people and our sovereignty. The safety and well-being of our citizens will always be paramount,\" Binay said.\n\nSen. Francis Tolentino agreed with Binay and suggested the filing of a case against China before the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.\n\nAny case that the Philippines may file should also include China's unlawful activities which have resulted in environmental degradation and the destruction of marine resources, he said.\n\n\"They have actually violated several specific treaties and conventions,\" Tolentino said. \"Their responses are all related. And these could be signs of desperation on the part of China.\"\n\n'Human rights violations'\n\nSen. Juan Edgardo Angara said the CCG's reported actions \"endanger... the lives of our Filipino troops stationed at the Ayungin Shoal and could be deemed as a violation of their human rights.\"\n\nSen. Risa Hontiveros said \"China's continued wanton disregard for valuable food resources is now on full display. It's not only the natural resources that they are wasting but also the food supply for our troops.\"\n\n\"Also deplorable is their blockade of a medical mission for the soldiers. Despicable and callous,\" she added.\n\n\"I trust that the Department of National Defense will reinforce our soldiers stationed [at] Ayungin Shoal. We will not allow China to relentlessly demean our troops, our people,\" Hontiveros said.\n\nSen. Joel Villanueva said President Marcos was right in branding as \"deceptive\" China's actions in the West Philippine Sea.\n\nReaction to speech\n\nIn his speech on May 31 before the Shangri-La Dialogue, an international defense forum in Singapore during his working visit there, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. criticized the \"illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive actions\" in the disputed waters but did not name China.\n\nChina, nevertheless, reacted to Marcos' speech, with its foreign ministry saying on Monday that \"It is very clear to the discerning eye who the Philippines is serving in its foreign policy and for whom it is working in its maritime operations.\"\n\n\"I like the word 'deceptive' because that's what China has been doing for quite some time,\" Villanueva said in a press briefing on Monday. \"No one believes in their circus. [China's] narrative is ridiculous and their claims are unfounded.\"\n\nSen. Ramon Revilla Jr. said, \"In no uncertain terms, what they are doing is inhumane.\"\n\n\"We are taking notice of the bullying and provocations against our countrymen and our nation. International law and comity between states must prevail and all contrary actions by any state party should stop,\" he said.",

        "body": "China warned countries around the South China Sea to be skeptical of America's \"geopolitical self-interest\" and accused the U.S. of stoking tensions in the region at a weekend global security conference.\n\nThe warning from China's Foreign Ministry was in response to claims by Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. of \"illegal, coercive, aggressive, and deceptive actions\" in the contested waters, a reference to Beijing and its territorial disputes with Manila, South China Morning Post reported.\n\nMarcos made the comments at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual summit in Singapore that has long been the barometer for relations between China and the U.S.\n\nThis year, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun held talks.\n\nDong was clear that despite the two officials meeting, China remained opposed to U.S. influence and its alliance-building in Asia, specifically pointing out America's support for Taiwan.\n\n\"These malign intentions are drawing Taiwan to the dangers of war,\" Dong said. \"Anyone who dares split Taiwan from China will be smashed to pieces and court their own destruction.\"\n\nDong's comments illustrate how frayed U.S.-China relations remain as Beijing ups its presence in contested waters off the South China Sea and as both nations try to find a middle ground at sea and in the air that would prevent tensions from spiraling into an all-out crisis.\n\nChina called the U.S. out on its interests in the area and said it played \"an extremely dishonorable role\" by supporting and cooperating with the Philippine side's abusive acts and using the South China Sea issue to provoke tensions between Beijing and other regional countries.\n\nChina added it was \"crystal clear\" who the Philippine foreign policy and its maritime operations serve, pointing to the United States.\n\n\"Regional countries should remain highly vigilant in this regard and firmly hold the leading role of regional peace and stability in their own hands,\" Dong said.\n\nIn 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague slammed China's behavior in the South China Sea and found its claim to sovereignty over the waters had no legal basis, giving Brunei, Indonesia, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Malaysia more leverage in their maritime disputes with China.\n\nThe landmark case was brought by the Philippines and was seen at the time as an important crossroads in China's push for global dominance and its rivalry with the United States.\n\nChina dismissed the ruling as illegal and argued Manila's \"unilateral initiation of international arbitration\" without Beijing's consent \"violated international law.\"\n\nDong also called out U.S. military activities in the disputed Second Thomas Shoal and said its deployment of a missile system in the Philippines was a \"real threat to regional security.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nAs Dong slammed the U.S., Austin underscored the \"importance of respect for high-seas freedom of navigation guaranteed under international law, especially in the South China Sea.\"\n\nAustin, in a speech on Saturday, warned against \"actions in this region that erode the status quo and threaten peace and stability,\" and added that \"we all share an interest in ensuring that the South China Sea remains open and free.\"",

        "body": "We are all invited to two different kinds of 'Stag Do' (for those in the US, Bachelor Party), which (for those in Australia) are also a 'No-Bucks Night'.\n\nApril US personal consumption income and spending data on Friday saw the former up 0.3% m-o-m as expected, but spending 0.2%, a tick lower, and real personal spending -0.1% vs. 0.1%, meaning inflation was biting. The core measure was 0.2% m-o-m, in line, as were the Fed's-favoured PCE y-o-y deflator at 2.7% and the core at 2.8%, but they remain above the 2% target. However, the Chicago PMI that followed was a disaster at 35.4 vs. 41.6 expected, its lowest reading since Covid lockdowns of May 2020. New orders and order backlogs both fell to May 2020 levels, plunging 9.2 and 8 points, respectively.\n\nThe reaction saw US Treasury yields dropping and stocks rising despite inflation not falling. Recall our Fed-watcher Philip Marey has been warning the US is heading for stagflation - and the four rate cuts he expects to see over 2024 and 2025 will only be due to the 'stag' not the 'flation' part. Backing his view, the Daily Mail reports 'A 'perfect storm' is wiping out America's restaurants', with dining out declining as lifestyles are forced to shift by higher prices. Fortune adds, 'The housing market is finally seeing more inventory, but buyers aren't showing up as a 'cold reality is settling down'. That offers the potential prospect of lower activity and lower prices - if owners sell, and lose their current low mortgage rate, rather than the housing market just freezing, not clearing.\n\nThe RBA's Hunter says the \"first and predominant challenge\" is bringing inflation down; yet he cited the Reserve Bank's dual full-employment mandate to explain why they aren't (yet) raising rates again in order to do it. Meanwhile, as house prices continue to soar further even before rates do anything in either direction, the ABC stresses a 'hidden home loans crisis' as 2 in 5 Australians with mortgage debt, some 5.8m people, say they will have real difficulty making payments over the next 12 months. In short, parts of the economy say rates need to come down: but inflation says the opposite.\n\nThe same is true in weaker form in Europe. The ECB meeting on Thursday is almost certain to see rates cut by 25bp. However, our team notes, \"one cut is no cut\" in practical terms, and \"lingering inflation risks tilt the odds towards a slower or shorter cycle than expected.\"\n\nCentral banks will be glad to see that while OPEC+ extended its voluntary production cuts of around 2m barrels a day through to Q3, oil is declining in response. However, Saudi Aramaco selling $12bn in shares in brisk trade does not suggest a truly bearish climate for oil, regardless of the global climate. Meanwhile, plenty of other commodities are going sharply higher - and we know what would happen to them and oil were rates to come down before inflation does.\n\nSo, that's one kind of 'Stag Do'. The other kind is the clashing of antlers.\n\nDomestically, that means elections, with potential market impact. India's PM Modi will retain his parliamentary majority, building the China > India market mojo switch; South Africa's ANC lost its majority for the first time since the end of Apartheid, with the outlook now unclear; Mexico's Claudia Sheinbaum, successor to outgoing President Obrador, is expected to win, meaning policy continuity; and former US president Trump claims to have raised $52.8m from small donors in one day post-conviction, and $200m over three days including larger donations - he also joined TikTok and gained 1m followers in an hour.\n\nA Bloomberg survey says a Trump win is a risk to Fed independence, which would \"likely rock financial markets\". 44% of respondents say they expect him to politicize the Fed or limit its power vs. just 6% who say he will leave it alone, and 35% who think he will use social media to lean on it. 24% say a Trump win would immediately cause 10-year Treasury yields to rise more than 25bps, 23% say a smaller rise would occur, and 24% that yields would fall. By contrast, 54% think Biden will leave the Fed alone --a low number reflecting the structural shifts towards a political-economy I flagged would emerge to roil markets-- 41% think he would lean on the Fed to urge lower rates to some degree, and 5% think he'd do more than that, while not specifying.\n\nThis week also sees the EU elections, which our team recently published a report on in regards to Europe's attempts to respond to economic and geopolitical challenges by building 'strategic autonomy', with market-moving implications.\n\nInternationally, the tail risks are also market moving. In the Middle East, President Biden floated a new peace proposal that could either see de-escalation or, if it fails, re-escalation. Ukraine used western HIMARS to attack Russia proper, after TASS warned 'Full-scale war between Russia, West can't be ruled out, expert says'. President Zelenskyy accused China of helping Russia sabotage his plans for a peace summit and prosecute its war, economically. The Philippines warned a clash with China in the South China Sea could spiral into war, as China's defence minister countered of the \"limits\" to its restraint. China also warned about the formation of an \"Asian NATO\", as Zelenskyy visits Manila.\n\nEU foreign policy chief Borrell said he has seen no evidence of Chinese military support for Russia, and its help to Russia is not comparable to Iran and North Korea - true in drones and munitions, but not for overall aid to a war economy. He then added the EU doesn't have the ability to sanction third countries that circumvent Russian sanctions: unwilling, maybe, but it is surely able. By contrast, a Financial Times op-ed from Deputy US Treasury Secretary Adeyemo ('We need to put sand in the gears of the Russian war machine') argues, \"the private sector must play its part in Putin's military-industrial complex\", specifically mentioning Russia's imports of dual-use inputs. That suggests EU firms, and banks, will need to do more, and more broadly, not less on this front.\n\nUnavoidable military rearmament will require a lot of bucks; and greater use of third country sanctions may mean many have even fewer in hand.\n\nMeanwhile, against this backdrop, Bloomberg also reports: \"War in the Middle East and Europe, US-China tensions, climate change, threats from new technologies - geopolitical risk is everywhere. A coterie of fund managers are pitching a class of ETFs that claim to offer a hedge for all that uncertainty. These funds, ranging in size from $8m to $800m in assets, strip out companies the managers say threaten national security or are vulnerable to state takeover or US sanctions... Champions of these ETFs view them as a corrective to what they see as Wall Street's agnostic view of geopolitical developments... [using] publicly available information to screen companies on a range of criteria, including whether they're under sanctions, work in cybersecurity, have been accused of human-rights violations, or have operated in disputed waters near China.\"\n\nThe idea is a good one - but how do these ETFs account for information that isn't publicly available, or project the second, third, fourth, nth order impact of on apparently safe firms from the spectrum of potential, conflating political and geopolitical tail risks now emerging? Surely a broader variety of hedging tools are required which look at scenario analysis and 'then what(s)?', including of the market kind mentioned in the Bloomberg survey above?",

        "title": "'The King's Speech'",
        "body": "IN 2010, the historical drama film \"The King's Speech\" was played across movie theaters. It depicted the struggle of Britain's King George VI, played by actor Colin Firth, to deliver a speech on a radio broadcast in the face of an approaching war with Germany in 1939. Due to King George VI's stuttering impediment, he was coached by a speech therapist, played by actor Geoffrey Rush. The film was a blockbuster success, earning more than $427 million with a budget of only $15 million.\n\n\"The King's Speech\" resonated well with the world's movie audience because it showed how an underestimated would-be king stepped up and overcame his speech defects to shore up his people's courage against Nazi Germany's war machine. As King George VI ascended to the throne, his first broadcast speech strengthened his people's resolve to confront the greatest threat to their national existence since becoming an empire and reverse the fear sweeping the British archipelago.\n\nThere are strong similarities between King George IV's speech and President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s keynote address at this year's International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore. Pummeled by the \"new opposition\" for the past months, the President demonstrated his geopolitical acumen, diplomatic eloquence and strategic foresight on the tensions happening in the South China Sea. He clearly articulated the legal and diplomatic groundwork of how the Philippines would assert its sovereignty while recognizing Asean centrality and urging Washington and Beijing to responsibly manage their rivalry on the world stage.\n\nLike King George VI's speech directed at Nazi Germany, President Marcos faces China with fierce determination and does \"whatever it takes to protect our sovereign home to the last square inch, to the last square millimeter.\" In President Marcos' exchanges with the audience, he pointed out, \"If you want peace, prepare for war.\" It is inferred that the President is willing to go to war for our maritime territory to the extent that he warned Beijing that if any uniformed personnel or even a Philippine citizen were deliberately killed in a clash with the China Coast Guard, it would be considered an act of war.\n\nLately, opposition forces have humiliated President Marcos as a weak, incompetent and disconnected leader on the domestic problems of the nation. Some have even recklessly insinuated that the President is addicted to cocaine and is a henpecked husband. But his riveting speech in the IISS Shangri-la Dialogue doused all these venomous comments as irrelevant to the present national exigencies. He galvanized the Filipinos to shun divisions and implored that only as a united people could we confront China's illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive actions. \"I do not intend to yield. Filipinos do not yield,\" the President echoed.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nPresident Marcos' speech has received accolades from world leaders and diplomats. It is a watershed moment for all Filipinos as likened to \"The King's Speech.\" Compared to his predecessor who vacillated in the face of China's intimidation, the President was steadfast in defending our territorial claims \"where we must, by constitutional duty, and by legal right, protect our interests.\" His impressive performance in the IISS Shangri-la Dialogue made Filipinos proud, fearless and unyielding against China's claims.\n\nSo, how far do I think President Marcos is willing to go?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his speech, the President vowed to bolster the country's defenses and to ensure a credible military posture in the contested areas of the South China Sea. He is prepared to fight a superpower like China if the situation escalates into a regional conflict and promised not to lose \"an inch\" of our territory. It is anticipated that the US would gain more access to forward operating bases in the Philippines, positioning mid-range ballistic missiles that can reach across the Taiwan Strait. He is expected to strengthen regional defense cooperation with Japan, Australia, India and Vietnam to hedge against Chinese threats. But other than the drumbeats of war, President Marcos is also willing to pursue efforts toward regional peace and stability. He has not closed the door to resolve the territorial disputes in the South China Sea diplomatically.\n\nBut above all, his speech has sparked a national sentiment that unites a divided Filipino nation on a contentious issue. Taking the cue from his fiery message, he laid out the \"red line\" that he hoped China would not cross, and if it did, then the country would have to cross the Rubicon. Like the \"King's Speech,\" there is now more compelling reason for all Filipinos to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the President and fight for our national sovereignty against insurmountable odds.\n\nPresident Marcos has found his inner voice to truly lead and rally the Filipino people.",

Broad international support will help enforce the sanctions imposed against Russia. It will help the besieged country scrape in as much material as it needs to frustrate the invasion.\n\nFor the Philippines, condemning the Russian invasion required a tough decision based on principle. The Philippines relies on Russia for critical raw materials, tourism inflows and possibly industrial investments. We are prepared to forego all these to help a struggling nation stand up against aggression.\n\nRecently, the Philippines found some spine in standing up to China's bullying. In President Marcos' keynote speech at the Singapore summit, he underscored our determination to assert our exclusive economic zone. He stressed that the international community has a stake in keeping the vital sea lanes running through the South China Sea open to commercial navigation.\n\nThe more assertive foreign policy adopted by the Marcos government increased our geopolitical profile. Other European countries have expressed their interest in forging security alliances with us. We are now seen as a major regional player in pushing back China's expansionist designs.\n\nRecently, President Marcos was invited to the White House for a tripartite summit with Japan's prime minister. That summit sets the groundwork for an effective regional alliance. It likewise produced numerous investment commitments to support Philippine development.\n\nThe foreign policy posture we now maintain vis-a-vis China will probably cost us billions in Chinese investments and assistance. But it establishes us as a reliable voice in strengthening a rules-based global order.\n\nOur foreign policy posture pits us against the transactional relations Beijing cultivates with some of our Southeast Asian neighbors. That makes us a thorn on China's side.\n\nOur foreign policy posture is magnified by rising tensions at the Taiwan Strait. Many analysts believe that Beijing is ready to forcibly incorporate Taiwan as a province of China against the will of its democratic citizens. The only way to avert that is to show that neighboring countries will be ready to defend Taiwan in the event of an attack from the mainland.\n\nTaiwan and the Philippines, like Ukraine, are standing up to bullying neighbors. We have no desire to fall into some undeclared Chinese sphere of influence in the region. We are strongly committed to democratic governance.\n\nTaiwan and the Philippines, like Ukraine, are prepared to stand our ground in the face of aggression. Convenience cannot be more important than principle.\n\nMost of our ASEAN partners are all too willing to pander to China for short-term commercial gains. The Philippines has been unable to get ASEAN support for its South China Sea claims because of this pandering. We have to seek support for our position from beyond the regional partnership.\n\nPresident Marcos' international profile improved dramatically since he adopted a tougher stance towards Beijing's claims. His is an increasingly important voice in a global community working to establish a rules-based international order. That should reap its own benefits further down the road.\n\nChina must eventually come around to appreciating our position favoring a rules-based international regime if she is interested in de-escalating regional tensions. It is not the Philippines that should come around to submitting to China's transactional diplomacy.\n\nZelensky sees through China's claims of neutrality in the Russia-Ukraine war. He understands that Beijing will be Moscow's most reliable ally as Russia slides towards isolation. In fact, he believes China has been actively campaigning to discourage other countries from participating in the Global Peace Summit.\n\nOver the next few months, Russia will be even more dependent on Chinese supplies of technology needed to keep up its war of aggression. China will increasingly put its trading networks at the service of Russian exports bottled up by sanctions.\n\nThat means, whether we like it or not, Ukraine and the Philippines become partners in breaking the power of the axis of tyrants seeking to redefine global politics according to its terms. We are destined to be allies of common fate in helping each other deter aggressive neighbors.\n\nZelensky's decision to visit Manila may appears spontaneous. The contrary is true. It is the outcome of a profound reading of the strategic realignments now happening.",

        "body": "BEIJING -- The US has played an \"extremely dishonorable role\" in backing the Philippines and using the South China Sea dispute to provoke relations between China and the region, China's Foreign Ministry said on Monday.\n\n\"It is very clear to the discerning eye who the Philippines is serving in its foreign policy and for whom it is working in its maritime operations,\" the agency said in response to recent remarks by Philippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr.\n\nChina is willing to continue to work with members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) including the Philippines to manage differences at sea and deepen sea-related cooperation, it said.\n\nMr. Marcos on Friday delivered the keynote address at a security forum in Singapore, criticizing what he described as illegal, coercive and aggressive actions by \"other actors\" in the South China Sea -- a censure of China, although he didn't name the country.\n\nMeanwhile, Senator Emmanuel Joel J. Villanueva dismissed a Chinese general's accusation that the Philippines is ruining regional peace by involving more countries in the sea dispute, saying the claim was not backed by proof.\n\n\"I don't think anyone is paying attention to what they are doing because no one believes in their (China) circus,\" he told a news briefing.\n\n\"Their narratives are ridiculous, their claims are unfounded, and we still go by our united stand that the West Philippine Sea is ours,\" he added, referring to areas of the South China Sea within Manila's exclusive economic zone.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in Manila did not immediately reply to a Viber message seeking comment.\n\nAt the Shangri-la Dialogue security summit in Singapore last week, Chinese Major General Xu Hui, commandant of the Chinese military's International College of Defense Studies, asked Mr. Marcos if the Philippines was risking regional peace by involving other parties.\n\nHe said Manila risked ruining the \"long-earned, long-lasting peace\" within ASEAN.\n\n\"There is no such thing as a regional issue any longer, and when we talk about the South China Sea, we have to also remember that the South China Sea is the passageway for half of world trade,\" Mr. Marcos responded. \"Peace and stability in the South China Sea and freedom of navigation in the South China Sea is a world issue.\"\n\nMore than $3 trillion worth of trade passes annually through the sea, which China claims almost in its entirety. A United Nations-backed tribunal in 2016 voided its claim for being illegal.\n\n\"In the end, the important thing is that we don't give up sovereignty over those islands and oceans,\" Senate President Francis \"Chiz\" G. Escudero separately told reporters.",

        "body": "MANILA (The Straits Times/ANN): The Philippines is attending the upcoming peace summit in Switzerland on the Ukraine war, disclosed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky following his surprise meeting with his Philippine counterpart Ferdinand Marcos Jr in Manila on June 3.\n\nThe two leaders met just two days after Mr Zelensky's unscheduled visit to Singapore during the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia's premiere defence forum, where he asked Asia-Pacific leaders to join the summit on June 15 and 16 aimed at bringing peace to his war-torn country.\n\n\"We discussed the inaugural Global Peace Summit and the importance of South-east Asian countries being represented there. I am pleased that the Philippines will participate in the summit,\" Mr Zelensky posted via his official account on social media platform X.\n\nIt remains unclear for now if Mr Marcos himself will attend the summit, or if a ranking official will be sent instead.\n\nThe two presidents were supposed to meet on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue at the weekend, but their schedules did not sync. Mr Zelensky then flew to Manila in the early morning of June 3.\n\nBoth leaders criticised China during the security forum, which was held amid growing tensions between Beijing and Manila over the South China Sea territorial dispute as well as the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nIn his keynote address in Singapore, Mr Marcos hit out at what he described as the \"illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive actions\" being taken in the disputed South China Sea, though he did not directly name Beijing.\n\nTensions have been boiling between Beijing and Manila during these past months, as the China Coast Guard has been firing water cannon on Philippine ships sending supplies to troops stationed at a remote outpost at a disputed shoal.\n\nMr Zelensky, meanwhile, held a separate press briefing in Singapore and accused China of allegedly helping Russia thwart the peace summit in Switzerland.\n\nDuring their meeting, Mr Marcos told Mr Zelensky that the Philippines is looking forward to working together with Ukraine in forging peace.\n\nHe also welcomed Ukraine's plan to open an embassy in the Philippines later in 2024.\n\n\"That's certainly very good news because we would very much like to continue to help, in any way, that the Philippines can through multilateral (channels) and (the) United Nations, and even through other agencies such as the European Union,\" said Mr Marcos.\n\nHe then reiterated the Philippines' support for Ukraine in its war against Russia.\n\n\"We will continue to do all that we can to promote peace and to bring an end to the fighting and to come to a political resolution of your country,\" Mr Marcos said.\n\n\"I think everybody fully understands that it is easier said than done, and it will be a difficult road to find our way back to the situation that is morally acceptable not only to Ukraine, but to the rest of the world,\" he added.\n\nIn November 2022, the Philippine leader had described Russia's invasion of Ukraine's territories as \"unacceptable\" and asked both nations to resolve the conflict in a diplomatic manner.\n\nThe Philippines also voted in favour of a UN General Assembly resolution condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMr Zelensky thanked Manila for its continued support.\n\n\"We're very thankful to be in here in your country which supports Ukraine, our territorial integrity and sovereignty. Thank you so much for your 'big word' and clear position about us, about this Russia occupation of our territories,\" he said. - The Straits Times/ANN",

        "title": "Facing up to China's Hybrid Warfare in the Pacific",
        "body": "The China Coast Guard is expanding its reach in the Pacific, part of a broader campaign to increase Beijing's security role in the region.\n\nThis year, for the first time ever, the People's Republic of China registered 26 China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels to operate in the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission Convention Area. The Convention manages 20 percent of the globe, from the Aleutians in the North Pacific, all the way down to the Southern Ocean.\n\nIt is also the area of the First, Second, and Third Island Chains.\n\nThe CCG, widely used for gray-zone operations in disputed waters, will soon legally be allowed to board any foreign fishing vessels on the high seas in the First, Second, and Third Island Chains.\n\nSince 2020, China has also had four Coast Guard vessels registered to monitor foreign fishing vessels in the North Pacific Fishing Commission Area. Starting from June this year, China will have the third largest maritime security presence patrolling throughout the whole of the Pacific, after the United States and Australia.\n\nThe CCG is the maritime branch of the People's Armed Police of China, which is led by the Central Military Commission of China. Its vessels are built to People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) specifications. The Coast Guard operates directly under the PLAN in a time of war.\n\nIn a steady process of attrition, Xi Jinping's China is challenging the existing strategic order, and doing so through acts below the threshold of warfare.\n\nChina is using multiple channels, and notably dual-use military-civil activities, to normalize and legitimize its growing military and intelligence presence in the Pacific. China's hybrid warfare activities are now the most significant traditional security threat in the Pacific. Xi has made it clear that Beijing does not share the values of the rules-based international order and has been telling the Chinese people to prepare for war.\n\nFor more than 70 years the sea lines of communication and chokepoints of the Pacific have been protected under the strategic denial policy of the United States and its regional security partners, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\nThe United States and its partners' strategic denial set up was one of the lessons-learned recommendations after World War II. It is aimed to exclude adversaries that do not share the same security interests and values from establishing a military presence in the Pacific.\n\nThe inherent weakness of the policy has always been that the many small island developing states within the Pacific benefit from the security guarantee but have no alliance commitment to it. There is no military agreement that binds the Pacific island nations together, though the 2000 Biketawa and 2018 Boe Declarations state that any security challenges in the region should be dealt with collectively.\n\nIn the Xi Jinping era, China has aggressively targeted states along the First, Second and Third Island Chain with gray-zone activity, foreign interference, and repeated attempts to set up a China-centered security alliance for the region.\n\nBut China's actions did not just begin when Xi came to power. For more than 24 years, the PLA has been providing in-depth training, doctrine, weapons, military vehicles and vessels, uniforms, and military buildings to the military forces of Tonga, Fiji, and Papua New Guinea. China's domestic intelligence agency, the Ministry of Public Security, has signed secret cooperation agreements with police departments in Fiji, Kiribati, Vanuatu, and Solomon Islands. PLAN vessels have been visiting the Pacific for 20 years for both military diplomacy and spying trips. The PLA is also accessing the Pacific by using PLA vessels and planes for humanitarian and disaster relief.\n\nA global military power requires friendly ports, airfields, and satellite ground stations in foreign countries. From Kiribati to Vanuatu to French Polynesia, Beijing-connected companies have repeatedly tried to gain access to militarily significant airfields and ports. China has been thwarted in all those efforts.\n\nInstead, over the last 10 years, funded by the Asian Development Bank and World Bank, China's state-owned enterprises have built the bulk of all strategic airports, ports, and ring roads in the island developing nations of the Pacific.\n\nChina's government sponsors foreign interference activities in every state and territory of the Pacific, which has a corrosive effect on local politics. That makes it hard for states to defend themselves against China's malign activities that affect their sovereignty such as illegal, unreported, unregulated (IUU) fishing.\n\nChina's distant-water fishing vessels without doubt the worst offenders for illegal fishing in the waters of the Pacific. For years China has been ranked by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime as the number one IUU fishing state in the world. China's distant-water fishing fleet is also ranked the worst in the world for human trafficking. The Chinese industrial fishing vessel illegal drift nets kill everything in their path, leaving nothing for local fisher folk. Chinese government documents describe the foreign territorial waters and high seas these vessels operate in as China's \"distant water fisheries,\" part of an entire industrial chain.\n\nWithin China's distant-water fishing fleet hides a state-subsidized maritime militia, which works in tandem with the CCG and PLAN to haze and intimidate maritime states such as Vietnam and the Philippines over territorial disputes. The Biden administration have labelled China's IUU fishing fleet, and their role as a maritime militia acting with with China's maritime security forces, as a \"national security concern.\"\n\nChina's aggressive gray-zone activities operate below the threshold of traditional warfare, making it difficult to get the political will for a coordinated response. However, the 2018 Boe Declaration redefined the concept of security in the Pacific region and highlighted the principle of non-interference in the domestic affairs of Pacific Island Forum Members.\n\nNow is the time for its signatories, the developing island states of the Pacific, and Australia and New Zealand, to work collectively to face up to the challenge of China's hybrid warfare in the Pacific, in the same way they are now working collectively to address the main nontraditional security challenge in the region, climate change.\n\nThe continued peace and security of the Pacific depends on it.",

        "body": "Chinese foreign ministry says Washington has played ‘extremely dishonourable role’ by supporting Manila’s ‘abusive acts’ in contested waters\n\nIt comes in response to Shangri-La Dialogue speech by Philippine president denouncing ‘illegal coercive’ actions in territorial disputes\n\nChina urged countries around the South China Sea to be wary of Washington’s “geopolitical self-interest” and maintain autonomy to keep the region stable.\n\nThe statement by China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs was in response to Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr’s remarks on Friday at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, where he decried “illegal coercive, aggressive and deceptive actions” in the contested waters – an apparent reference to Beijing and its territorial disputes with Manila, though he did not mention China by name.\n\nThe Chinese foreign ministry said the Philippines was “solely responsible” for the recent escalation in the South China Sea.\n\nIt also took aim at the United States, saying the country had played “an extremely dishonourable role” by supporting Manila.\n\n“The United States, out of geopolitical self-interest, has played an extremely dishonourable role by supporting and cooperating with the Philippine side’s abusive acts and using the South China Sea issue to provoke tensions between China and regional countries.\n\n“At present, it is crystal clear who the Philippine foreign policy and its maritime operations serves … Regional countries should remain highly vigilant in this regard and firmly hold the leading role of regional peace and stability in their own hands.”\n\nBeijing said it was willing to continue to cooperate with members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), including the Philippines, to manage differences and deepen maritime cooperation, according to the statement.\n\n“With the joint efforts of China and Asean countries, the situation in the South China Sea has remained generally stable. The freedom of navigation and overflight enjoyed by all countries in accordance with the law poses no problem,” it added.\n\nIn his speech at the opening of the Shangri-La Dialogue, Marcos stressed the importance of upholding international law in asserting Manila’s claims in the South China Sea and referred to a “binding” 2016 ruling by a tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, which rejected Beijing’s territorial claims over the waters.\n\n“Any effort to resolve maritime differences in the East China Sea and the South China Sea must be anchored in international law,” Marcos said in the speech, adding that “we must … respect legally settled rights”.\n\nChina views the international tribunal’s ruling as illegal and has argued that Manila’s “unilateral initiation of international arbitration” without Beijing’s consent “violated international law”.\n\n“China did not accept or participate in the South China Sea arbitration case … nor accept any claims or actions based on the ruling. China’s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea will not be affected by the ruling under any circumstances,” the ministry said.\n\nChina claims most of the South China Sea, but the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei have competing territorial claims over the resource-rich waterway.\n\nSince Marcos took office two years ago, the Philippines has been the most assertive country in the region in countering Beijing’s territorial claims in the disputed waters.\n\nDespite not having any territorial claims in the South China Sea, Washington is committed to upholding freedom of navigation in the waters and supporting its Southeast Asian allies, including the Philippines.\n\nIn his meeting with US counterpart Lloyd Austin on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue, Chinese Defence Minister Dong Jun accused the US of endangering security in the region with its support of the Philippines.\n\nHe said US military activities in the disputed Second Thomas Shoal – known as Renai Jiao in Chinese and Ayungin Shoal in the Philippines – and its deployment of a missile system in the Philippines were “a real threat to regional security”.\n\nAustin, on the other hand, underscored the “importance of respect for high-seas freedom of navigation guaranteed under international law, especially in the South China Sea” during his talks with the Chinese defence chief, according to a Pentagon statement.",

        "body": "China has accused Britain's secret intelligence agency MI6 of recruiting Chinese government employees as spies.\n\nChina's Ministry of State Security said in a post on its official WeChat channel that MI6 agents turned a Chinese man, known only by his last name Wang (王) and his wife Zhou (周), against Beijing.\n\nBoth men worked in the 'key secrets' department of Chinese state agencies.\n\nThe Foreign Office claimed MI6 began grooming Mr Wang when he went to the UK to study under a China-Britain exchange program in 2015.\n\nAgents gave him \"special care\" in the UK, including inviting him to dinners and trips to \"better understand his interests and weaknesses\", the MoD claimed.\n\nThe BBC has asked British authorities to respond.\n\nThis comes just over a month after Britain indicted two men on charges of spying for China. British police accused them of providing \"articles, notes, documents or information\" to foreign countries, while China called the claims \"malicious slander.\"\n\nA former Royal Marine accused of assisting Hong Kong intelligence was found dead earlier this month, police said.\n\nBeijing and several Western countries are increasingly accused of espionage.\n\nChina did not say how it uncovered the incident involving Mr. Wang and Mr. Zhou, saying only that it came after a \"thorough investigation.\"\n\nChinese authorities claimed MI6 agents took advantage of Mr Wang's \"strong desire for money\" and befriended him on campus by posing as a graduate, enticing him to provide \"paid consulting services\".\n\nAfter a period of time, the agents assessed that \"the situation was ripe\" and asked him to serve the British government in exchange for better pay and security offers, China's Ministry of State Security claimed.\n\nMI6 agents hired Mr Zhou to spy for China through Mr Wang, he added.\n\n\"The king hesitated at first, but could not resist. [the operatives'] \"After repeated persuasion, seduction, and even coercion, he finally agreed,\" the Ministry of National Defense said in a statement posted on WeChat.\n\n\"At Wang's strong instigation, Zhou agreed to gather intelligence... and he and his wife became British spies.\"\n\nThe Ministry of Defense added that the incident is still under investigation. It was not revealed whether the couple would be charged.\n\nChina may now make the case public as a form of retaliation, but China had arrested people on spying charges before the British incident, said Zhong Zaian, a non-resident scholar at Carnegie China.\n\nDr Chong said it was difficult to confirm the veracity of China's claims until more information was available.\n\n\"Sometimes these things don't show up. Especially in espionage cases, it can be especially difficult to understand the details of the case due to the opacity of China's systems, including the judicial system,\" he added.\n\nChina's Ministry of State Security has been posting frequent updates on its official channels since its launch last August.\n\nLast January, the government warned citizens about 'exotic beauties' trying to lure them into the hands of foreign intelligence agencies.\n\nAmong other things, it warned citizens not to photograph military equipment, and warned against organizations that \"recruit aviation enthusiasts as volunteers\" to transmit China's flight data to other countries.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online",

        "title": "Chinese defense minister denounces 'outside forces' at security forum",
        "body": "Dong Jun warns that there are limits to Beijing's restraint in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait.\n\nBy RFA Staff 2024.06.02 -- Chinese Minister of National Defense Dong Jun launched an acerbic attack on what he called the \"hegemonic powers\" behind tension in the Asia-Pacific, a clear swipe at the United States and its allies.\n\nIn an address to the annual Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore, Adm. Dong said that people in the Asia-Pacific are \"independent and self-reliant,\" and were \"against any attempt to turn our countries into vassal states or draw us into bloc confrontations.\"\n\n\"Our people have firmly rejected infiltration, sabotage and coercion by outside forces,\" the minister said, adding that regional countries \"despise those who attempt to bolster themselves by taking orders from hegemonic powers.\"\n\nDong also said China had exercised great restraint in the face of what he called \"infringements and provocations\" but warned \"there is a limit to our restraint.\"\n\nBeijing has repeatedly accused Washington of assisting Taipei and Manila to stand up to its assertive actions in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea.\n\nThe Pentagon last month deployed an intermediate range missile system in the Philippines during the annual Balikatan military drills, which Beijing condemned as bringing \"huge risks of war into the region.\"\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives has recently passed an $8-billion package to help Taiwan boost its defense capabilities against China.\n\nDong said that \"some external interfering forces keep hollowing out the One China principle with the salami slicing strategy.\"\n\n\"They have cooked up Taiwan-related legislations and continued to sell arms to Taiwan and have illegal official contacts with it.\"\n\nThe minister, who took office five months ago after his predecessor was removed over suspected corruption, went on a lengthy tirade against Taiwanese leaders who he called \"Taiwan independence separatists.\"\n\nChina considers the democratic island one of its provinces and Dong said that China \"will take resolute actions to curb Taiwan independence and make sure such a plot never succeeds.\"\n\nHe accused Taiwan's leaders of \"betrayal of the Chinese nation and their ancestors,\" and said they would be \"nailed to the pillar of shame in history.\"\n\n\"The Taiwan question is at the core of China's core interests,\" the minister said. \"Anyone who supports Taiwan independence will only end in self-destruction.\"\n\nDefense analyst Malcolm Davis from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, or ASPI, said that Dong \"made clear a willingness for China to use force to prevent independence and respond to any external forces involved in supporting Taiwan.\"\n\n\"It was a fairly predictable speech and very much the 'party line' with little in the way of new comments. In effect this was a propaganda speech and not an accurate statement of Chinese policy,\" Davis said.\n\n'Wolf warriors'\n\nBut Dong's tone did seem more combative than that of his predecessor, Li Shangfu, he added.\n\n\"On the South China Sea, he issued a warning that China won't rule out the use of force specifically in relation to the Philippines and the support of the United States,\" the Canberra-based analyst said, \"That suggests to me that China does intend to escalate the crisis, and has singled out the Philippines as their focus with the goal being to coerce Manila to capitulate to Chinese interests.\"\n\nUnlike Li and his predecessors, Dong is not a member of the Central Military Commission of the Chinese communist party - the highest national defense organization.\n\n\"That may be the reason behind Dong's tough statements to show his clout and get a promotion,\" said an Asian analyst who didn't want to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.\n\nA Chinese academic praised Dong's speech and said his attendance at the conference helped bring \"China's real voice\" to the world.\n\n\"The Shangri-La Dialogue as a major security forum bears a great relevance to China,\" said Gao Zhikai, vice president of the Center for China and Globalization and chair professor at China's Soochow University. \"It is important that China's voice, which is increasingly in sharp contrast to that of the U.S., be heard.\"\n\nSeveral other Chinese delegates also promoted Beijing's views at the forum, in a forthright manner known as \"wolf warrior\" diplomacy.\n\nThe term, adopted from the title of a Chinese movie, describes an assertive, even aggressive, approach to international relations.\n\nMaj. Gen. Xu Hui, president of the International College of Defense Studies at China's National Defense University, confronted Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. after the latter's keynote speech on Friday, saying that Manila was risking ruining the \"long-earned, long-lasting peace\" within ASEAN by responding to Chinese vessels' activities in the disputed South China Sea.\n\nOn Saturday, another Chinese delegate, Senior Col. Cao Yanzhong, a researcher at China's Institute of War Studies, questioned U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin about the U.S. alliance system in the region which Beijing compares to \"an Asian version of NATO.\"\n\nDuring a session on 'Maritime Law Enforcement and Confidence Building' on Saturday, another Chinese delegate, Senior Col. Ge Hanwen, associate professor at the College of International Studies at China's National University of Defense Technology, blamed the Philippines for \"dramatically\" raising tensions in the region and Japan for using water cannons first in a confrontation at sea.\n\nAustin and Dong met for about an hour at the conference on Friday for talks aimed at improving their communications, a U.S. official said.\n\nNew regional order\n\nA Western observer at the forum, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Radio Free Asia that the Chinese delegates are \"on a mission to spread Beijing's messages and their statements are pre-scripted and pre-approved by the [communist] party.\"\n\nBeijing-based Gao denied that.\n\n\"It is only normal that people from all walks of life, including military officers, talk about the topics of their interest,\" Gao said.\n\n\"China attends a lot of international forums because we believe in having our voice heard by as many people as possible.\"\n\nDong acknowledged that different countries had different security interests and goals but he implied that China had a leadership role, said the ASPI's Davis.\n\n\"He kept pushing the implication that China speaks for the region in terms of shaping the future of Asia-Pacific security order,\" Davis said.\n\n\"China is clearly setting the basis for trying to assert its dominance over ASEAN, and if it can get [the] Philippines to submit to Chinese power through military coercion, then Beijing will expect other ASEAN states to also accept China's interests,\" said the Australian analyst.\n\n\"By default, China would then dominate the region.\"\n\nOver the past decade, the Chinese military has become more powerful, with its rapid growth bringing a new confidence, especially in relation with the United States.\n\nThe Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a recent report that China is the world's largest shipbuilder with a capacity some 230 times larger than the U.S.\n\n\"One of China's large shipyards, such as Jiangnan Shipyard, has more capacity than all U.S. shipyards combined,\" the center said in its report.\n\n\"China is way ahead of the U.S. in many aspects and the Chinese economy is soon to be larger, too,\" Gao, who served as a translator for Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping during the 1980s, told RFA.\n\n\"The Americans are worried about a rising China, that Beijing will impose its ideological and political system on the U.S.,\" he said, while adding that in his opinion, that fear was unfounded.\n\n\"No one can really decouple from China and the best Washington can do is to deal with China on an equal footing.\"\n\nLyle Goldstein from the U.S. think tank Defense Priorities said that Beijing was \"not reckless or aggressive,\" and despite the threats, it had not used force since the 1980s.\n\nDespite a downward spiral in U.S.-China relations, Goldstein suggested that the two countries and their militaries, \"should meet halfway and resolve disputes through diplomatic compromise.\"",

        "body": "China's defense minister has warned the US over the deployment of ballistic missiles in the Asia-Pacific region, stressing that there are \"limits\" to Beijing's restraint in dealing with such acts of provocation in the South China Sea.\n\nDong Jun raised the alarm at an international security forum in Singapore on Sunday in a clear reference to the United States and the Philippines, which have been boosting their military ties to contain what they claim to be China's growing military might and influence in the strategic body of water.\n\n\"China has maintained sufficient restraint in the face of rights infringements and provocation, but there are limits to this,\" Dong told the Shangri-La Dialogue, which is attended by defense officials from around the world.\n\nThe two longstanding treaty allies, the United States and the Philippines have been working to consolidate their alliance and partnership in the Asia-Pacific region, which has enraged Beijing.\n\nThe US Army said in April that it had deployed a Mid-Range Capability missile system capable of firing the Standard Missile 6 (SM-6) and the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile in the northern Philippines for annual joint exercises.\n\nDong said the deployment of \"medium-range ballistic missiles\" was \"severely damaging regional security and stability.\"\n\nManila and Beijing have a long history of maritime territorial disputes in the South China Sea but tensions have worsened under Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, with Manila pivoting to Washington, which supports the country in its maritime dispute with China.\n\nChina rebuked the Philippines in a statement in February for its unfriendly maneuvers in the South China Sea, saying Manila \"stirs up trouble\" by holding joint air patrols with \"extraterritorial countries.\"\n\nChina's Southern Theater Command underlined that it had coordinated with its frontline naval and air forces to closely monitor the Philippines' joint military maneuvers.\n\nChina's claim of sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea overlaps with the maritime claims of the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam and Brunei, in addition to, Chinese Taipei, also known as Taiwan.\n\nAlso, China has constructed several artificial islands over the past few years in the Spratly archipelago in the South China Sea, which is a marginal sea of the Western Pacific Ocean. The move has drawn harsh criticism from the Philippines and the United States.\n\nThe South China Sea is believed to sit atop vast reserves of oil and gas.\n\nBeijing ready to 'forcefully' stop Taiwan's independence\n\nAddressing the three-day annual forum, Dong also warned that the Chinese military is ready to \"forcefully\" stop Taiwan independence.\n\nDong reiterated Beijing's position that Taiwan is part of China and expressed commitment to peaceful reunification.\n\n\"The Chinese People's Liberation Army has always been an indestructible and powerful force in defense of the unification of the motherland, and it will act resolutely and forcefully at all times to curb the independence of Taiwan and to ensure that it never succeeds in its attempts,\" China's defense minister said.\n\n\"Whoever dares to split Taiwan from China will be crushed to pieces and suffer his own destruction.\"\n\nDong also blamed separatist forces for eroding the \"One China\" principle, which states Beijing's view that it has sovereignty over Taiwan.\n\nIn a meeting with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Friday, Dong emphasized Beijing's demand that the United States should not support Taiwan independence by providing military aid to Taipei in any shape.\n\nHowever, Austin told the forum on Saturday that Washington would maintain its presence in the Indo-Pacific region by forging military alliances with regional countries.\n\nBeijing had cut its military-to-military communications with the United States in 2022 in response to then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.\n\nBeijing considers Chinese Taipei as one of mainland China's provinces with no right to establish diplomatic relations with other states. China's globally-accepted \"one China\" principle, which the United States has accepted, keeps Taiwan out of most international bodies.\n\nChina never supplied arms to parties in Ukraine war\n\nElsewhere, Dong told the Shangri-La Dialogue that Beijing has not supplied weapons either to Russia or to Ukraine and strictly controls exports of dual-purpose goods since the war began in the former Soviet republic.\n\n\"We have never supplied weapons to either party in the conflict. We have established strict control over exports of dual-purpose and never did anything that could fire up the situation,\" the defense minister said.\n\nChina is always holding a reliable position on the Ukrainian issue and supports peace talks, Dong added.",

I do not intend to yield.

        "title": "China's approach to global security elaborated at Shangri-La Dialogue",
        "body": "Defense minister reiterates firm stances on Taiwan question, South China Sea issue\n\nBy Li Aixin and Guo Yuandan in Singapore and Liu Xuanzun in Beijing Published: Jun 02, 2024 06:42 PM Updated: Jun 02, 2024 11:21 PM\n\nChinese Defense Minister Dong Jun on Sunday introduced China's approach to global security on the closing day of the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, as he offered Chinese thoughts on resolving global security issues with a global perspective, while reiterating China's firm stances on the Taiwan question and the South China Sea issue.\n\nIn his speech at a plenary session at the Shangri-La Dialogue on Sunday, Dong said that China's vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind, together with the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, echoes the trend of history and responds to the longing of people around the world for a better life.\n\nThe Chinese military stands ready to work with other counterparts to deepen security cooperation and make more contributions to safeguard lasting peace and common prosperity in the Asia-Pacific as well as the world, said the Chinese Defense Minister.\n\n\"People in the Asia Pacific are committed to harmony and peace, are independent and self-reliant, and always support each other through thick and thin. We will not allow hegemonism and power politics to undermine the interests of Asia Pacific countries. We will not allow anyone to bring geopolitical conflicts or wars whether hot or cold, into our region. We will not allow any country or any force to create conflict and chaos in our region,\" he said.\n\nThe Chinese side is willing to work with all parties to protect the legitimate security interests of all countries, build a more just and reasonable international order, give full play to regional security architecture, advance open and pragmatic defense cooperation, set an example of maritime security cooperation, strengthen security governance in emerging areas, create a new situation of regional security cooperation, and continue to make the Asia Pacific an anchor for global development and stability, Dong said.\n\nZhang Chi, an associate professor at the National Defense University of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), told the Global Times on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue on Sunday that Dong's speech was pitched at an overarching global perspective, ranging from history to reality, from Asia to the world, and explained how China as always stands ready to pursue common security and common prosperity with all other countries, offered Chinese thinking and elaborated on Chinese efforts to tackle the current regional security issues.\n\nCompared with the speech delivered by US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin on Saturday, Dong's speech stood at regional and global heights focusing on the entirety of humanity, Zhang said, noting that Austin focused mainly on the US and its allies and partners in the region, revolved only around its own egoistic and selfish interests, and ignored the centrality of ASEAN in regional cooperation.\n\nThe core of Austin's speech is that the US aims to achieve leadership in the \"Indo-Pacific\" region through initiatives such as AUKUS, the Quad and other military alliances, while also subtly hinting at the creation of an \"Indo-Pacific version of NATO,\" which is a flawed strategic understanding and misguided perception of security that experts said engenders turmoil, conflict and even war, instead of fostering security and stability.\n\nGiven the ongoing conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, the Asia Pacific is one of the few regions in the world that still enjoys stability today. It is clear which global security approach, China's or the US', fits more the core interests and legitimate security concerns of the most countries, observers said.\n\nChina values peace and harmony, pursues common security, upholds equality and mutual respect, and emphasizes openness and inclusiveness, but it also firmly safeguards its core interests, Dong said in his speech.\n\nOn the South China Sea issue, Dong said that the current situation in the South China Sea is generally stable. He urged a certain country to see where its true interests lie, and return to the right track of dialogue and consultation.\n\nChina has exercised enough restraint in the face of infringements and provocations, but there is a limit, Dong warned, without naming the Philippines, which has frequently trespassed into waters off Chinese islands and reefs in the South China Sea since August 2023 under the instigation of the US. It has seen its provocations dealt with by the China Coast Guard (CCG) through legitimate, professional and restrained restrictive measures.\n\nOn the Taiwan question, Dong stressed that safeguarding China's national sovereignty and territorial integrity is the sacred mission of the Chinese military. \"We will take timely and resolute actions to stop 'Taiwan independence,' and make sure their attempts never succeed,\" he said.\n\nLieutenant General He Lei, former vice president of the Academy of Military Sciences of the PLA, told the Global Times on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue on Sunday that China's approach to global security also covers the South China Sea and the Taiwan Straits.\n\nChina remains committed to peaceful reunification, but under the instigation of external interfering forces, the Taiwan authorities are now unilaterally changing the status quo on the one-China principle, which is the biggest threat to peace and security in the Taiwan Straits, bringing risks of conflict and war, He Lei said, urging the \"Taiwan independence\" secessionist forces to learn from Dong's elaboration on China's approach to global security, see itself as a part of a community with a shared future, and reunify with the motherland as soon as possible.\n\nThe same applies for the South China Sea disputes, as countries should resolve disputes through peaceful talks and negotiations and safeguard the security in the region through joint efforts, said He Lei.\n\nChanges needed\n\nWhen answering a question and introducing China's stance on the Taiwan question, Dong was interrupted by the moderator, but he insisted on finishing his elaboration.\n\nThe experts noted that the Shangri-La Dialogue this year had a fierce \"crossfire\" of stances, starting by the arrangement that the keynote speech was delivered by Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr on Friday.\n\nParticipants said that the forum was staged to suppress and smear China, particularly this year.\n\nCao Yanzhong, a research fellow at the Academy of Military Sciences of the PLA, told the Global Times that the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), the organizer of the Shangri-La Dialogue, is a research institute serving British and US strategies, and all of its operation is backed by the US.\n\nAccording to the IISS' website, the sponsors of the Shangri-La Dialogue include some of the US' top arms dealers, including Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Northrop Grumman.\n\nWarwick Powell, adjunct professor at the Queensland University of Technology, told the Global Times at the forum that the Shangri-La Dialogue is a creature of history, as it emerged in a time when the countries of the Global South were voiceless, and questions of security, even in the Asia region and the Asia-Pacific more broadly, bore the marks of centuries of colonialism. Security in Asia was a question for colonial powers to come and talk about how they would maintain security in a region far from their own homes and how they would teach the locals about security.\n\n\"However, the world has changed, and I hope the Shangri-La Dialogue will respond to these changes and evolve accordingly,\" said Powell.",

        "body": "Durian demand and Chinese investors’ interest in the Philippines’ green-energy sectors seen as promising opportunities, according to China-based diplomats from the Southeast Asian nation\n\nBut analyst says that while China has ‘other trade options available’, there is a lack of ‘desirable trade alternatives’ for the Philippines\n\nDespite recent tensions between China and the Philippines, with the two sides increasingly squaring off over sovereignty claims in the South China Sea, diplomats are hoping to stem the tide of declining trade.\n\nThe Southeast Asian country will continue exploring the Chinese market’s interest in tropical agricultural products – including coconuts and highly sought-after durians – and wants to become more attractive to investors in sectors that China has seen come under mounting pressure from Western countries, according to a pair of Philippine diplomats based in China.\n\nAnd they said these areas could include renewable energy, green metals manufacturing, agribusiness and food process, as well as electric vehicles and lithium batteries that have faced scrutiny from Western countries.\n\n“The Philippines is committed to encouraging stable relations and close communication with regard to any issues related to bilateral trade and investments,” Emmanuel Ang, commercial counsellor of the Philippine embassy in China, told the Post by email.\n\n“We anticipate that our trade relationship with our largest trading partner will remain robust, stable and steadily growing in the coming years.”\n\nThe comments came as bilateral relations recently took another hit from Beijing’s fresh allegations in the territorial face-off at sea – contending that troops stationed on a grounded Philippine warship on a disputed reef in the South China Sea pointed guns at a Chinese coastguard patrol last month.\n\nIn 2023, China was the Philippines’ top importer and second-largest export destination after the United States, with a 23.3 per cent share of imports and 14.8 per cent share of exports, respectively, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority.\n\nIn the first four months of this year, the value of trade between China and the Philippines stood at US$22.46 billion, marking a 10.31 per cent year-on-year decline, according to Chinese customs data. In contrast, China’s trade value with the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) during the same period saw an 4.8 per cent year-on-year increase to US$$306.9 billion.\n\nThe shift has aroused speculation among analysts that the South China Sea dispute could be spilling over into trade relations.\n\nWhen meeting in Beijing in January 2023, Philippine and Chinese leaders agreed on four priority areas of cooperation, including infrastructure, agriculture, energy and people-to-people exchanges. At the time, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr said the hope was to move relations with China into “higher gear”, while seeking “to settle problems in a friendly manner”.\n\nHowever, rows have since escalated, with both sides increasingly confronting each other in disputed waters.\n\nAnd in February, Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Enrique Manalo said Manila needed to find new trade opportunities to build economic resilience amid fears of trade sanctions from China.\n\nAng, with the Philippine embassy, attributed a 16 per cent year-on-year fall in last year’s bilateral trade value to an overall slowdown of trade.\n\n“China’s trade with the world, and also with Asean as a whole, also experienced declines,” he said, citing a weak external environment and downward trend of goods prices. Also, “China’s domestic consumption has yet to rebound to the pre-pandemic level”.\n\nNonetheless, Ang foresees burgeoning business opportunities as Philippine durians were granted market access to China starting last year, with traders “excited to supply to this new market” estimated to be worth around US$6 billion.\n\n“We also hope to increase exports of other agricultural products such as coconut products and marine products,” Ang said. “We also wish to increase the penetration rate of Philippine products in the Chinese e-commerce space, especially [food] products from Philippine [small and medium-sized enterprises].”\n\nIn terms of Chinese investment, he said: “We are encouraging them and helping with B2B, especially in the currently popular areas of renewable energy, renewable energy equipment manufacturing, iron and steel processing, green metals processing, electric vehicle- and battery-related businesses, agribusiness and food processing, and manufacturing.”\n\nTo mitigate any concerns out of the private sector, Ang said the Philippine embassy has increased efforts to organise and participate in various trade events, including the China-Asean Expo and the China International Import Expo, to showcase how bilateral trade and investments are developing healthily.There are many areas where China and the Philippines can complement each other in their economic and trade relationsVictor Gao, Centre for China and Globalisation\n\nGlenn Penaranda, commercial counsellor of the Philippine consulate general in Shanghai, said Philippine companies are continuing to pursue opportunities in China’s vast market, and such efforts have been underscored by Beijing’s charm offensive to lure back foreign investors after the pandemic.\n\n“We are currently working with several companies, and we are optimistic that collaboration in pursuing opportunities in our respective markets and in third markets will drive continued productive engagements,” he said via email.\n\nPenaranda also spoke to how Philippine companies are seeking partnerships with Chinese companies in areas including green metals, renewable energy, real estate infrastructure and related equipment.\n\n“There are many areas where China and the Philippines can complement each other in their economic and trade relations, which Manila’s foreign policy needs to take into account,” said Victor Gao, vice-president of the Beijing-based think tank Centre for China and Globalisation.\n\nThe Philippines is China’s 24th-largest trading partner, with annual bilateral trade of US$71.9 billion, behind France and ahead of Italy, Chile and Switzerland, according to Chinese custom data. China imports considerable quantities of Philippine pineapples, bananas, nickel ore and a type of coal called lignite.\n\nGao said that political frictions have already affected bilateral economic cooperation, with fewer state-owned enterprises investing in the Southeast Asian nation and numerous large-scale Chinese infrastructure projects in the country suspended since Marcos Jnr took office in June 2022.\n\n“China does not depend solely on the Philippines for specific imports, as it has other trade options available,” Gao said. “But it is more difficult for Manila to find more desirable trade alternatives.”\n\nAccording to Manila’s statistics agency, 60.83 per cent of the Philippines’ iron and steel was imported from China last year, compared with 48.34 per cent in 2018.\n\nEduardo Araral, an associate professor of public policy at the National University of Singapore, said nickel ore prices in the Philippines have dropped because “demand in China is slowing down”, and that competition from other Southeast Asian countries could be affecting fruit shipments to China.\n\n“If there’s a decline … Vietnamese suppliers have stepped up,” he said. “The supply from Vietnam has gone up, probably.”\n\nAnd Jonathan Ravelas, managing director of the Manila-based consultancy eManagement for Business and Marketing Services, said Chinese interest in Philippine fruits may have declined due to perceptions over “product quality” – stemming from either real issues or complaints arising from political disagreements.\n\nAt the height of bilateral tensions between the two countries during the Scarborough Shoal stand-off in 2012, Beijing imposed tighter controls and banned imports of bananas from the Philippines, alleging that they had mealybugs.\n\nThe shoal, known in China as Huangyan Island, is located within the Philippines’ 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone, but is claimed by China. It is one of several islets that the two countries dispute.",

The Philippines had violated its obligations, \"incited disputes at sea and joined forces with foreign powers, displaying military might\", as well as \"spreading false information that discredits China.\"\n\n\"It becomes clear whose interests are being served by the foreign policy of the Philippines, for whom it is working by taking actions in the sea,\" the statement said. \"Countries in the region need to stay vigilant and always make sure that they themselves are the ones sitting in the driver's seat when it comes to the peace and stability of the South China Sea.\"",

        "body": "Sydney, Jun 3 (360info) COP28 signalled the 'beginning of the end' of the fossil fuel era. But more finance and a focus on equity can facilitate adaptation in vulnerable countries.\n\nNovember's COP29 in Azerbaijan does not seem likely to lead to more ambitious climate plans.\n\nAlso Read | Mumbai Local Train Services of Western Railway Hit Due to Technical Issues at Borivali Station: Live News Updates Today.\n\nWith ongoing geopolitical tensions, high interest rates, and upcoming pivotal elections in the US, the UK, and the European Union, countries will have the task of navigating climate goals while dealing with concurrent equity, socio-economic and geopolitical challenges.\n\nAt 2023's COP28 Summit, negotiations started on a high note, as the world finally agreed to move away from fossil fuels. Negotiators from 200 parties came together with a landmark agreement to increase climate action before the end of this decade to keep within the 1.5-degree Celsius target.\n\nAlso Read | Earthquake in Japan: Quake of Magnitude 5.9 on Richter Scale Strikes Ishikawa Prefecture, No Tsunami Threat.\n\nBut despite the first Global Stocktake finding the world is off-track in meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement, consensus on other key issues remained elusive, including the level of ambition in emission reduction targets.\n\nWhile some countries committed to aggressive targets in line with scientific recommendations, others stopped short, citing debt and ballooning costs as barriers to pushing for more ambitious goals.\n\nDespite calls for bold action, COP28 lacked clear commitments and timelines for a full coal phase-out. The Least Developed Countries Group, composed of representatives from 45 low-income countries, argued that COP28 outcomes reflected the lowest possible ambition that they could accept.\n\nThe need for increased climate finance\n\nUN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell called climate finance the \"great enabler of climate action\". COP28 had a promising start: The Green Climate Fund reached a record USD 12.8 billion from 31 countries with new pledges from Australia, Estonia, Italy, Portugal, Switzerland and the United States.\n\nBut as noted in the First Global Stocktake, this is far from matching the scale of funding needed to address the irreversible loss and damage risks affecting marginalised groups and people living in poverty in the Global South, estimated at USD 116-435 billion in 2020 to USD 1.1 to 1.7 trillion per year by 2050. These estimates do not include the non-economic loss and damage such as loss of social cohesion, cultural heritage and identity which are impossible to quantify.\n\nThe agenda for COP29 is set to focus on the New Collective Quantified Goals on climate finance. This refers to the commitment from developed countries to mobilise from a floor of USD 100 billion per year to address the needs and priorities of developing economies.\n\nDeliberations on the quantity, quality, and what these goals need to address are still underway and were described by Climate Action Network Europe as \"slow and unproductive\". COP29 should collectively and decisively come up with new financial goals that are in line with the needs of developing countries.\n\nEquity issues at COP29\n\nThere are also equity issues surrounding the upcoming COP.\n\nFor one, the Azerbaijani Government nominated an all-male organising committee for the conference, following the longstanding tradition of ignoring the important role that women play in climate action. This resulted in a strong and immediate backlash from the international community, prompting the government to add 12 women to its 41-member committee.\n\nCOP29 is hosted in an authoritarian petrostate known for its human rights violations against environmentalists and journalists. Amnesty International and others have called on Azerbaijan to commence meaningful reforms prior to COP29 and place human rights at its core.\n\nFossil fuel lobbyists might also be granted access to the negotiations, similar to what happened at COP28. The presence of the world's biggest polluters will have a significant influence on the COP presidency and participating parties.\n\nThere is also a worrying trend of some parties attempting to remove the language referencing the special circumstances of least developed countries and small island developing states.\n\nThe principle of special needs and circumstances is a fundamental element of the Paris Agreement and is more than necessary to advance climate justice. COP29 should put the needs and aspirations of these two groups at the forefront of proposed solutions.\n\nCalls for peace and financial transparency\n\nAmid the worsening geo-political tensions such as the territorial disputes in the South China Sea and the Israel-Gaza conflict, Azerbaijan is calling for peace and might ask the parties to observe a \"COP truce\" to prevent future climate-fuelled conflicts.\n\nThe President-designate of COP29, Mukhtar Babayev, has also called on low-income countries to be transparent over climate spending to develop trust.\n\nThis is all very ironic as the host country itself is accused of discrimination and ethnic cleansing of Armenians in the heavily contested Nagorno-Karabakh region, and is known for its lack of transparency and corruption in its oil and gas industry.\n\nWhile peace, stability and transparency are certainly important, these should not distract us from our sobering reality: we are not on track with our climate commitments, the impacts of climate change will only get worse, and the rich companies and fossil fuel companies should foot the climate bill.\n\nBabayev claims: \"I will build bridges between the diverging north and south to keep 1.5 degree C in reach.\"\n\nOne can only hope that this is not empty rhetoric.\n\nA 'real' transition away from fossil fuels requires concrete steps to fully stop fossil fuel, adequate financing to support the most vulnerable countries, and preferential treatment for least developed countries and small island developing states.\n\nUntil this is done, COP29 and other future COPs may continue to fall short.

Illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive actions continue to violate our sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction,\" Mr Marcos said.\n\nEncounters between the Philippines and China in Asia's most contested waters have grown more tense and frequent during the past year, as Beijing presses its claims to shoals in waters that Manila says are well within its exclusive economic zone.\n\nChina's coast guard has stepped up so-called grey-zone activities such as use of water cannons, collisions and ramming tactics to try to stop Philippine resupply and patrol missions. It has also deployed fishing boats that the Philippines and its allies consider militia.\n\nThe Philippines, a treaty ally of the United States, is a key focus of Washington's efforts to strengthen alliances and partnerships in the Asia-Pacific region as it seeks to counter China's growing military might and influence.\n\nGiven its position in the South China Sea and proximity to self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims as its own, Philippine support would be crucial for the US in the event of any conflict.

        "body": "Sydney, Jun 3 (360info) COP28 signalled the 'beginning of the end' of the fossil fuel era. But more finance and a focus on equity can facilitate adaptation in vulnerable countries.\n\nNovember's COP29 in Azerbaijan does not seem likely to lead to more ambitious climate plans. With ongoing geopolitical tensions, high interest rates, and upcoming pivotal elections in the US, the UK, and the European Union, countries will have the task of navigating climate goals while dealing with concurrent equity, socio-economic and geopolitical challenges.\n\nAt 2023's COP28 Summit, negotiations started on a high note, as the world finally agreed to move away from fossil fuels. Negotiators from 200 parties came together with a landmark agreement to increase climate action before the end of this decade to keep within the 1.5-degree Celsius target.\n\nBut despite the first Global Stocktake finding the world is off-track in meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement, consensus on other key issues remained elusive, including the level of ambition in emission reduction targets.\n\nWhile some countries committed to aggressive targets in line with scientific recommendations, others stopped short, citing debt and ballooning costs as barriers to pushing for more ambitious goals. Despite calls for bold action, COP28 lacked clear commitments and timelines for a full coal phase-out. The Least Developed Countries Group, composed of representatives from 45 low-income countries, argued that COP28 outcomes reflected the lowest possible ambition that they could accept.\n\nThe need for increased climate finance UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell called climate finance the \"great enabler of climate action\".

I am pleased that the Philippines will participate in the summit,\" Mr Zelensky posted on his official account on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nIt remains unclear for now if Mr Marcos himself will attend the summit or a ranking official will be sent instead.\n\nThe two presidents were supposed to meet on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue over the weekend, but their schedules did not sync. Mr Zelensky then flew to Manila on June 3 early morning.\n\nBoth leaders criticised China during the security forum, which was held amid growing tensions between Beijing and Manila over the South China Sea territorial dispute as well as the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nIn his keynote address in Singapore, Mr Marcos hit out at what he described as the \"illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive actions\" being taken in the disputed South China Sea, though he did not directly name Beijing.\n\nTensions have been boiling between Beijing and Manila these past months, as the China Coast Guard has been firing water cannons on Philippine ships sending supplies to troops stationed at a remote outpost at a disputed shoal.\n\nMr Zelensky, meanwhile, held a separate press briefing in Singapore and accused China of allegedly helping Russia thwart the peace summit in Switzerland.\n\nDuring their meeting, Mr Marcos told Mr Zelensky that the Philippines is looking forward to working together with Ukraine in forging peace.\n\nHe also welcomed Ukraine's plan to open an embassy in the Philippines later in 2024.\n\n\"That's certainly very good news because we would very much like to continue to help, in any way, that the Philippines can through multilateral (channels) and (the) United Nations and even through other agencies such as the European Union,\" said Mr Marcos.\n\nHe then reiterated the Philippines' support for Ukraine in its war against Russia.\n\n\"We will continue to do all that we can to promote peace and to bring an end to the fighting and to come to a political resolution of your country,\" Mr Marcos said.\n\n\"I think everybody fully understands that it is easier said than done, and it will be a difficult road to find our way back to the situation that is morally acceptable not only to Ukraine, but to the rest of the world,\" he added.",

Thank you so much for your ‘big word’ and clear position about us, about this Russia occupation of our territories, and thank you on your support,” Zelensky was quoted as saying.\n\nIn turn, the palace said Marcos Jnr told the Ukrainian president it was “very good news” that the latter’s country would soon be opening an embassy in Manila this year “because we would very much like to continue to help, in any way that the Philippines can, through multilateral [efforts] and the UN”.\n\nThe Philippine leader pledged to “do all we can to promote peace and to bring an end to the fighting”, referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia.\n\n“It will be a difficult road to find our way back to a situation that is morally acceptable not only to Ukraine, but to the rest of the world,” Marcos Jnr noted.\n\nThe palace news release also stated: “President Marcos shared that the Philippines has been trying to promote the continuing adherence to international rules-based order as he reiterated the country’s efforts to advocate for peace and do everything it can to promote that peace.”\n\nThis was an oblique reference to Marcos Jnr’s repeated assertion that China should adhere to the “international rules-based order”, especially in an ongoing territorial dispute in the South China Sea.\n\nA 2016 arbitral ruling by an international tribunal, which was later dismissed by Beijing, stated that China’s nine-dash line was without basis under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The nine-dash line had enclosed both the Ayungin and Scarborough shoals – the main flashpoints between both sides – as within Chinese maritime territory.\n\nRetired Supreme Court associate justice Antonio Carpio told This Week in Asia he was “not surprised” by Zelensky’s sudden visit, adding this “shows how strategic the Ukrainians see the conflict”.\n\nExplaining why the visit was in the national interest of Manila, he said: “In Europe, Russia is trying to overturn the foundational UN Charter principle that all disputes between states must be settled peacefully, outlawing the use of force or the threat of force to settle such disputes.\n\n“In Europe, Russia is overturning this principle by invading and annexing a part of Ukraine to settle a territorial dispute. In the South China Sea, China is using threat of force to settle territorial and maritime disputes with China’s neighbours.”\n\nCarpio, who has made the South China Sea dispute a personal advocacy, said “both Russia and China are trying to overturn the foundational principle of the UN Charter that ‘Right is Might’”, a concept that he claimed “led to two world wars”.\n\nThere had been speculation the Ukrainian leader would visit Manila the night before he landed but the palace did not confirm this. Zelensky had come from the Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore, where he had called on Asian countries to join a June 15 peace summit in Switzerland.\n\nZelensky, wearing his signature casual black shirt with Ukrainian symbol, khaki cargo pants and rubber shoes – attire that would have been banned in Malacanang – was accorded an honour guard.\n\nA small contingent of high government officials – clad in semi-formal wear and led by Marcos Jnr, followed by his cousin House Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez and foreign secretary Enrique Manalo – greeted Zelensky inside.\n\nAt a press briefing on the sidelines of the Singapore forum, Zelensky had also accused China of pressuring other countries to boycott the Switzerland peace summit. Beijing has not responded to this salvo.\n\nZelensky said he had anticipated talking to Marcos Jnr on the sidelines of the forum but the Philippine leader had left shortly after giving a keynote speech on Friday night, so he had taken up Manila’s invitation to visit the palace.\n\nMonday’s meeting marked the second time both leaders discussed the Ukrainian crisis. On February 1 last year, Marcos Jnr posted on social media platform “X” that he and Zelensky had a phone conversation in which the latter thanked him “for supporting [the] sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine”.\n\nIn May last year, during the Centre for Strategic and International Studies Asean Leadership Forum in Washington, Marcos Jnr said: “The Philippines has been very clear in our support for the resolutions in the United Nations that were passed upon the onset of the war in Ukraine. And that we respect the sovereignty and territoriality of every single nation in the world.”\n\nHe called Ukraine’s situation “incredibly critical” and said Asean member states “are in full agreement” over the need to protect the sovereign rights of each nation, calling the situation in Ukraine “something that is really anachronistic in the modern world”.\n\nThe Philippine president’s remarks over the past year contrast starkly with his on-the-fence stance when he was running for the presidency. In March 2022, he had declared during a forum that the Philippines should side with no one in the war between Ukraine and Russia.\n\n“I don’t think there’s a need to take a stand. We are not involved except for our nationals,” he had said then, noting that Manila’s main concern was how to repatriate its nationals living in Ukraine.",

He said Moscow is doing \"everything\" to disrupt the conference set for June 15-16 by using Chinese influence and its diplomats.\n\nMarcos, for his part, criticized Beijing's \"assertive\" actions in the disputed South China Sea in his speech Friday at the defense forum. The Chinese delegation responded by condemning the Southeast Asian nation's moves to deepen military alliance with the U.S., saying it threatened peace and stability in the region.\n\n_____\n\n(With assistance from Andreo Calonzo and Clarissa Batino.)",

Chinese officials claim that U.S. involvement is provoking regional conflicts. Despite tensions, China expressed willingness to work with ASEAN countries, including the Philippines, to manage maritime disputes and deepen cooperation.\n\nChina said the United States has played an \"extremely dishonourable role\" in supporting and cooperating with the Philippines, using issues in the South China Sea to provoke relations between China and the region. \"It is very clear to the discerning eye who the Philippines is serving in its foreign policy and for whom it is working in its maritime operations,\" China's foreign ministry said on Monday in response to recent remarks by the Philippine president.\n\nChina is willing to continue to work with ASEAN countries, including the Philippines, to manage differences at sea and deepen sea-related cooperation, it said. President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr on Friday denounced illegal, coercive and aggressive actions in disputed waters of the South China Sea.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

He said Moscow is doing \"everything\" to disrupt the conference set for June 15-16 by using Chinese influence and its diplomats.\n\nMarcos, for his part, criticized Beijing's \"assertive\" actions in the disputed South China Sea in his speech Friday at the annual defense forum. The Chinese delegation responded by condemning the Southeast Asian nation's moves to deepen military alliance with the US, saying it threatened peace and stability in the region.\n\n--With assistance from Daryna Krasnolutska and Clarissa Batino.",

        "title": "Japan must tread carefully amid South China Sea tensions, say experts",
        "body": "As Japan seeks to boost defense cooperation with the Philippines amid a Manila-Beijing territorial row that has escalated tensions in the South China Sea, experts are counseling Tokyo to take a cautious approach as the region balances the competing agendas of China and the United States.\n\nThe recent intensification of hostility between the Philippines and China in the disputed waters was highlighted at this year's Asia Security Summit, where Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. rapped Beijing for its \"illegal, coercive actions\" and argued strongly for the protection of the rules-based order in his speech.\n\nJapan has joined U.S.-led efforts to bolster defense ties with the Philippines, in a move seen as pushing back against China's ambitions in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nBeijing claims almost the entire area of the resource-rich South China Sea and has ongoing territorial rows with fellow littoral states, including Vietnam and Malaysia.\n\nManila asserts its sovereign rights in the South China Sea, and it started to call parts of the sea within the country's exclusive economic zone \"the West Philippine Sea\" in 2012.\n\nTokyo's pursuit of greater security cooperation with Manila and other regional countries is welcome as Southeast Asian nations need partner diversity, not just aligning with either the United States or China, said Evan Laksmana, senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the host of the Singapore gathering.\n\nTokyo has taken part in joint maritime exercises with the Philippines, the United States and Australia in the South China Sea. In April, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida held the first-ever trilateral summit with Marcos and U.S. President Joe Biden in Washington.\n\nIn July, Japan and the Philippines will likely sign an agreement allowing their defense forces to train in each other's territories during a meeting involving the two nations' foreign and defense ministers, according to Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro.\n\nIn addition to Japan, other alternative security partners for the region include South Korea, Australia, France and Britain.\n\nBut Japan is unique because it has a \"strategic capital\" built around pragmatic cooperation and economic engagement over decades in Southeast Asia, the International Institute for Strategic Studies' Laksmana pointed out.\n\nHe warned some of that strategic capital can be eroded if Japan is \"seen as just an extension of the United States\" and \"overtly playing geopolitical cards\" when the region is very sensitive about polarizing moves.\n\n\"Japan has a great potential because of its long strategic capital, but if it does not play its cards right, I think it could be seen as Japan engaging in security cooperation with Southeast Asian countries as part of its competition against China,\" Laksmana said.\n\n\"If that is perceived as a problem, then I think it may not be successful,\" he added.\n\nChina has huge economic clout in the region and the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations maintains the principle of neutrality toward major powers, refraining from taking sides amid the intensifying rivalry between Beijing and Washington.\n\nSome ASEAN countries like Cambodia and Laos, this year's chair, are seen as pro-Beijing. Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei also have territorial disputes with China, but tensions are less intense compared with Manila's.\n\nMarcos' controversial predecessor Rodrigo Duterte appeased China and did not take a clear stance in opposition to its territorial advances in the South China Sea.\n\nASEAN and China have long been drafting a code of conduct to prevent confrontations in the South China Sea, but negotiations have stalled due partly to distrust generated by Beijing's harassment of other claimant states, said Tomotaka Shoji, director of the Regional Studies Department at the National Institute for Defense Studies.\n\nShoji said the Philippines under Marcos's leadership has sought alternative measures to ASEAN's approach amid a lack of progress on the code of conduct negotiations, namely aligning with the United States and its allies to keep China in check.\n\nSaya Kiba, associate professor at Kobe City University of Foreign Studies, indicated the Marcos government's \"transparency initiative\" to expose China's harassment toward Philippine vessels in the South China Sea has succeeded in gaining more international support for Manila's position.\n\nThe initiative launched last year allows journalists to board Philippine vessels and report pictures and videos of incidents.\n\nSince the policy started, more than a dozen European countries have expressed their support, despite their geographical distance, for a 2016 ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague that invalidated China's sweeping claims in the South China Sea, she said.\n\nBeijing has rejected the court's decision and continued its military buildup in the area.\n\nKiba said Japan can help the Philippines enhance its maritime security capabilities through the provision of additional patrol ships and surveillance technology. It can also back Manila's transparency strategy to gain more support for its sovereignty in line with the 2016 ruling.\n\nHowever, she said Manila \"does not want to be seen as clinging to the United States\" in the same way as other ASEAN member states that do not take sides with Beijing or Washington are viewed.\n\nIn his keynote speech at the conference known as the Shangri-La Dialogue, Marcos said both China and the United States are important in the region, referring to Beijing's \"determining influence\" over its economic evolution and \"the stabilizing presence of America\" that is \"crucial to regional peace.\"\n\nAlthough moves by the United States and Japan to deepen security cooperation with the Philippines have triggered speculation that they may seek Manila's support in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, the Southeast Asian country has refrained from making mention of its stance in such a contingency, she said.\n\n\"The Philippines upholds the one-China principle and the general public does not support their country being dragged\" into a Taiwan emergency, Kiba said.\n\nMarcos said the Filipino people have \"a long history of fraternal bonds with the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait\" and urged \"all parties to exercise restraint on the issue.\"\n\nShoji also said when Japan joins efforts to counter China's maritime assertiveness in the South China Sea, it should be careful not to \"give China a reason to take a bold action\" in the East China Sea, where Beijing regularly sends vessels near the Tokyo-controlled Senkaku Islands to press its territorial claim.\n\nFor instance, Beijing reportedly regarded Tokyo's participation in the U.S. freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea as a \"red line\" that must not be crossed, he said. Japan has not joined those operations to avoid friction with neighboring countries.\n\n\"Japan should pay attention to the situations both in the South and East China seas to strike a balance and craft its strategies,\" Shoji said.",

        "body": "\"The substantive request that we had out of the meeting with China was to grow the defense dialogue,\" Marles told Reuters\n\nSINGAPORE: Australia has asked for military talks with China and is comfortable growing closer to the Philippines, Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles said on Sunday at the Shangri-La Dialogue security summit.\n\nChina and the Philippines are locked in confrontation in the disputed South China Sea and their encounters have grown more tense as Beijing presses its claims to shoals in waters that Manila says are well within its exclusive economic zone.\n\nAustralia has stepped up its presence in the region and a joint amphibious exercise with the Philippines at Palawan island in August was Australia's biggest outside its own borders last year.\n\nAustralia has also said its recent encounters with China's military fell short of being safe and professional, and Marles said he discussed the issue with Chinese defense chief Dong Jun on the sidelines of the conference on Saturday.\n\n\"The substantive request that we had out of the meeting with China was to grow the defense dialogue,\" Marles told Reuters.\n\n\"We really want to get it ultimately back to where it was before it was stopped, and that would be at the level of our chiefs of defense force and our secretaries of defense meeting annually.\"\n\nMarles also held talks with Philippines Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue.\n\n\"We definitely think that this is a moment where our relationship with the Philippines is really being taken to a level it's never been before, and we very much welcome that,\" said Marles.\n\n\"What we're now seeing is a strategic dimension to that relationship being put in place, and that's something that we greatly welcome, and we see this as growing even further.\"",

        "body": "The United States and other nations could take steps against Chinese firms and financial institutions over Beijing's backing for the Russian war against Ukraine, a top U.S. official said.\n\nThe Biden administration has stepped up warnings about China's backing for Moscow and issued an executive order in December that threatened punitive measures against financial institutions helping Russia skirt Western sanctions.\n\n\"I think where we are primarily focused are on Chinese companies that have been involved in a systematic way in supporting Russia,\" U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell told reporters near the Virginia town of Washington when asked if the Chinese leadership and banks could be targeted.\n\n\"We've also looked closely at financial institutions.\"\n\nThe State Department's second-ranked official spoke at the start of a meeting with the vice foreign ministers of Japan and South Korea, Masataka Okano and Kim Hyong Kyun. The three allies have stepped up cooperation in the face of shared concerns about China, North Korea and Russian's war in Ukraine.\n\nEarlier this week Campbell said there was an urgent need for European and NATO countries to send a collective message of concern to China.\n\n\"There will be steps that are taken, not just by the United States, but other countries, signaling our profound displeasure about what China is seeking to do in its relationship with Russia on the battlefield in Ukraine,\" he said on Friday.\n\nCampbell met China's Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu on Thursday and raised U.S. concerns about Beijing's support to Russia's defense industrial base undermining European security, the State Department said.\n\nCampbell said his talks with his South Korea and Japanese counterparts would prepare the way for a trilateral leaders' summit later this year. He said the date wasn't yet set, but the meeting was of the \"highest priority.\"\n\nIn a joint statement from Friday's meeting, the allies reaffirmed their commitment to use their \"collective capacity to strengthen security and maintain peace and stability across the Indo-Pacific.\"\n\nThey pledged to continue working closely to boost economic security, including through Minerals Security Partnership projects, which are aimed at lessening reliance on China and Russia for critical resources needed in high-tech applications.\n\nThe allies also committed to work \"ever more closely to support Ukraine's energy infrastructure, recovery, and efforts to hold Russia accountable for its actions,\" the statement said.\n\nCampbell welcomed \"renewed diplomacy\" between China, Japan and South Korea, after leaders from the three countries met on Monday for the first time in four years. The two U.S. allies had offered a \"very deep and sincere debrief\" on their three-way meeting with China, he said.\n\nHe also commended Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr for a speech he gave at the Shangri-La Dialogue defense summit in Singapore, where the Asian leader alluded to \"illegal, coercive and aggressive\" actions by China in the disputed South China Sea.\n\nCampbell praised the speech as strong and purposeful, but would not directly answer a reporter's question on whether any incident involving China's Coast Guard that resulted in a Philippines service member being killed would trigger Washington's mutual defense treaty with Manila, calling it \"hypothetical.\"\n\nEncounters between the Philippines and China in Asia's most contested waters have grown more tense and frequent in the past year as Beijing presses its claims to shoals in waters that Manila says are well within its exclusive economic zone.\n\n\"We fundamentally believe that the United States and the Philippines are moving towards a closer set of relations in which we will be able to deepen our security partnership,\" Campbell said.\n\nSource: Reuters (Reporting by David Brunnstrom, writing by David Ljunggren and Michael Martina; Editing by Doina Chiacu, Chizu Nomiyama and Cynthia Osterman)",

        "title": "China warns SCS patience wearing thin",
        "body": "China's Defense Minister Dong Jun warned over the weekend that Beijing's restraint in the South China Sea (SC) has limits, in a thinly veiled threat to the Philippines and United States over their presence in the disputed waters.\n\nSpeaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue conference in Singapore on Sunday, Dong referenced a \"certain country,\" encouraged by external powers, which had allegedly engaged in \"mediated provocations.\"\n\n\"China has maintained sufficient restraint in the face of rights infringements and provocation, but there are limits to this,\" Dong said.\n\nThe Chinese official's comments followed President Ferdinand Marcos Jr's denunciation of \"illegal, coercive, and aggressive actions\" in the South China Sea by China in the same defense forum in Singapore last Friday.\n\nMarcos warned that the death of any Filipino citizen at the hands of another country in the South China Sea would be \"very close\" to an act of war.\n\n\"What would happen if there was an incident that ended up killing a Filipino serviceman, be it a Coast Guard or in the military and part of the Navy. Well, that would be -- that would certainly increase the level of response and if by a willful act on a Filipino, not only a serviceman but even a Filipino citizen. If a Filipino citizen is killed by a willful act, that is I think a very, very close to what we define as an act of war and, therefore, we will respond accordingly,\" he said.\n\nMDT invocation\n\nMarcos made the response when asked what actions would prompt the Philippine government to invoke the decades-old Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) with the United States. The treaty holds that both countries would come to the defense of each other in case of an attack by a third party.\n\nBeijing has frequently accused Washington of supporting Taipei and Manila in resisting its assertive actions in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea.\n\nLast month, the Pentagon deployed an intermediate-range missile system in the Philippines during the annual Balikatan military drills, which Beijing condemned as introducing \"huge risks of war into the region.\"\n\nChina asserts control over nearly all of the South China Sea, a vital route for over $3 trillion in annual ship-borne trade. This claim includes areas also claimed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei. In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled that China's claims had no legal basis.\n\nTaiwan issue\n\nIn response to Chinese actions in the region, Marcos has pursued closer relations with the United States.\n\nAlso on Sunday, Chinese state media reported that personnel on a Philippine ship aimed guns at China's Coast Guard in the SCS. Philippine officials have yet to respond to the claim at press time.\n\nCCTV maintained at least two individuals on the Philippine vessel near the shoal were seen carrying guns on deck, pointing them toward the CCG ship, according to China's CCTV news channel.\n\nAn accompanying 29-second video seemed to show a masked man briefly holding up a blurred black object resembling a rifle. CCTV claimed that the purported incident took place during a Philippine mission to deliver supplies to troops.\n\nGiven its position in the South China Sea and proximity to self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims as its own, Philippine support would be crucial for the United States in the event of any conflict.\n\nDong also reiterated that China is ready to \"forcefully\" stop Taiwan's independence moves but called for greater exchanges with the United States.\n\n\"We have always been open to exchanges and cooperation, but this requires both sides to meet each other halfway,\" Dong told the meeting where he met with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Friday.\n\n\"We believe that we need more exchanges precisely because there are differences between our two militaries.\"\n\nDong and Austin met for over an hour at the luxury hotel hosting the forum, which is attended by defense officials from around the world and in recent years has been seen as a barometer of US-China relations.\n\nAfter the meeting, Austin said that telephone conversations between US and Chinese military commanders would resume \"in the coming months\", while Beijing hailed the \"stabilising\" security relations between the countries.\n\nThis year's Shangri-La Dialogue comes a week after China held military drills around self-ruled Taiwan and warned of war over the US-backed island following the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te, who Beijing has described as a \"dangerous separatist\".\n\n\"The Chinese People's Liberation Army has always been an indestructible and powerful force in defence of the unification of the motherland, and it will act resolutely and forcefully at all times to curb the independence of Taiwan and to ensure that it never succeeds in its attempts,\" Dong told the forum on Sunday.\n\n\"Whoever dares to split Taiwan from China will be crushed to pieces and suffer his own destruction.\"\n\nOn the South China Sea, which China claims almost entirely and where it has been involved in confrontations with Philippine vessels, Dong warned of \"limits\" to Beijing's restraint.\n\n\"China has maintained sufficient restraint in the face of rights infringements and provocation, but there are limits to this,\" Dong said.\n\nFlashpoint disputes\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration and China have been stepping up communication to ease friction between the nuclear-armed rivals, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken visiting Beijing and Shanghai last month.\n\nA key focus has been the resumption of military-to-military dialogue, which is seen as critical to preventing flashpoint disputes from spinning out of control.\n\nChina scrapped military communications with the United States in 2022 in response to then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.\n\nTensions between Washington and Beijing were further stoked by issues including an alleged Chinese spy balloon that was shot down over US airspace, a meeting between Taiwan's then-president Tsai Ing-wen and Pelosi's successor Kevin McCarthy and American military aid for Taipei.\n\nChina is also furious over the United States' deepening defence ties in the Asia-Pacific, particularly with the Philippines, and its regular deployment of warships and fighter jets in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea.\n\nBeijing views this as part of a decades-long US effort to contain it.\n\nThe two sides agreed after a summit between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Biden last November to restart high-level military talks, including over military operations near Taiwan, Japan and in the South China Sea.",

        "body": "Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) chief Admiral Ronnie Gil Gavan stressed that water cannons aboard maritime vessels must only be used to save lives as he urged other countries to stop using them to attack fellow coast guards.\n\nGavan touched on the use of water cannons during his speech in a recently concluded special session on Maritime Law Enforcement and Confidence Building at the 21st Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore.\n\n\"The use of water cannons against fellow coast guards, well obviously, it doesn't look good. There is this proportionality in the use of force vis-à-vis the political message it sends. So, we're not very comfortable with that, so I hope that stops,\" he said.\n\nWhile China Coast Guard officials were present in the session, Gavan did not particularly mention which Coast Guard units or from which countries have been using water cannons to attack PCG units.\n\nNonetheless, the Philippine government, through its Department of Foreign Affairs, had filed numerous official complaints against Beijing for its coast guard's use of water cannons and \"dangerous maneuvers\" against the PCG.\n\nThose protests centered on China Coast Guard actions against PCG vessels, particularly at Ayungin (Second Thomas) Shoal, where the ship BRP Sierra Madre was grounded as a Philippine military outpost.\n\n\"The PCG finds moral strength in following what several fora have found to be among the most legally compliant and humane rules on the use of force,\" Gavan said.\n\nHe stressed the PCG remains steadfastly professional, patient, and respectful and \"that its fitted water cannons, or more properly called fire monitors or ships, are not meant to light up the fire.\"\n\n\"They are there to save lives and property from fire or simply to put off fire. Never to hose down one to pieces to start a fire,\" he added. \"This is how we exist and intend to live our role for our country and the rest of the global users of the WPS/SCS.\"\n\nGavan pointed out that the international community recognized the challenges being faced by the Philippines over its territorial claims in the South China Sea.\n\n\"We just have to go back to the basics of humanity. If we embrace together what is right, we won't be wrong,\" he said.\n\nIn the same forum, Ge Henwen from Beijing said Chinese fishermen also experienced water cannon attacks from Japan, noting that they are not the first country to use such force.\n\n\"If I'm not wrong, the Japanese Coast Guard was the first one who use water cannons toward Chinese fishing boats and fishermen. Maybe everyone, you can find hundreds of pictures in the Internet from the 1990s to 2000s, 2010s,\" he said.\n\nThe Chinese official emphasized the need for dialogue in handling territorial disputes.\n\n\"It's better for us to sit down and talk and negotiate under the framework of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea instead of unilaterally sending military or semi-military personnel to intrude into the Rén'ài Jiāo,\" Ge said, referring to the increasing tension in the Ayungin Shoal.\n\nThe change in the Philippine government's foreign policy \"has resulted in the increase of tension in the region,\" he added.\n\nOn the other hand, Gavan said the United States and Japan have expressed willingness to conduct joint maritime sails with the Philippines.\n\n\"Even without these developments, the United States Coast Guard and Japan Coast Guard have been in talks with us on how they can help us better perform our role. I think talks are underway on how we can do things better,\" he said.",

The Mekong, long a source of regional bounty, has become a modern point of contention for the countries along the waterway, with disputes over the environmental and economic cost to the river flow from the growing number of upstream dam and canal projects.\n\nCambodia's planned 180-kilometre Funan Techo Canal, worth US$1.7 billion, is funded by China as a part of the Belt and Road Initiative. This canal provides a waterway linking the capital Phnom Penh and the deep seaport in the coastal province Kep, ultimately opening onto the South China Sea. The Cambodian government hopes that this ambitious project may foster economic development by facilitating the transportation of goods and eco-tourism, along with an estimated 5 million jobs to be created. Moreover, the Funan Techo waterway would reduce Cambodia's dependence on Vietnam's seaport, notably Cai Mep.\n\nThe canal project may bring economic benefits to Cambodia, however, it has lead to mounting concerns within neighbouring Vietnam. Water security is a particular concern, with the canal is thought to act like a dam, altering the flow of the river and preventing water from reaching areas in the Mekong Delta in the south of Vietnam. This would not only exacerbate the present long-term drought and growing problems with salination affecting Vietnamese agriculture, but also impact the habitat of endangered species.\n\nThe project also brings geopolitical anxiety for Vietnam. The canal thought to have \"dual-use\" potential - that is, promoting economic growth and domestic connectivity for Cambodia, but it could also facilitate China's military presence in the country. The canal is said to connect the Ream naval base in Sihanoukville, recently refurbished with Chinese funding. A CNN report in December last year showed that two Chinese navy frigates docked at the base. Security concerns have been raised about the ability of vessels to transit the Funan Techo canal from the Gulf of Thailand.\n\nCambodian officials have defended the aims of the project. Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Manet claimed the canal would have minimal effects on Vietnam and that there would be no foreign military base on Cambodia's territory in line with Article 53 of its constitution. His father, and former Cambodian leader Hun Sen, declared the canal would not strain the Vietnam-Cambodia relationship. Meanwhile, the United States and Vietnam have called for more information and transparency about the canal.\n\nThe Funan Techo canal is a further example of Cambodia's economic reliance on China and Beijing's considerable economic influence in Southeast Asia. This concern is not only for Vietnam but extends to the unity and consensus of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. In 2012 and 2016, Cambodia blocked a ASEAN statement on the South China Sea dispute, which stymied Vietnam's effort to internationalise the issue and call for regional support.\n\nHanoi's influence in Phnom Penh has evidently decreased - a relationship that has a tumultuous history, with Vietnam having militarily intervened in Cambodia in 1978, maintained its influence in the country for a decade, and then significantly supported the Hun Sen's government. Anti-Vietnam sentiment in Cambodia runs deep, as the stage for the clash of ancient empires seeking dominance in Indochina, with the Nguyen dynasty's territory expansion southward over land regarded by Cambodians as \"Kampuchea Krom\", and illegal Vietnamese migrants in Cambodia.\n\nChina describes Cambodia as its \"ironclad\" friend in Southeast Asia. The Mekong is watery thread that these regional rivalries are seeking to bend in their favour.\n\nJuki Trinh is a PhD student at School of Political Science and International Studies, the University of Queensland.

        "body": "Click here to get Khmer Times Breaking News direct into your Telegram\n\nMinister of National Defence General Tea Seiha expressed concern that the Asia-Pacific region has entered an era of turmoil in international relations as the political environment has changed and become unpredictable.\n\nThe remarks were made when Gen Seiha addressed the International Institute for Strategic Studies' (IISS) Shangri-La Dialogue 2024, under the topic \"Building Cooperative Security in the Asia-Pacific\" in Singapore for three days from May 31 to Saturday.\n\nGen Seiha, who is also a Deputy Prime Minister, said, \"In the Asia-Pacific region, security is of mutual concern and has long-term consequences, these include increased security issues, climate change, water resources, food security, energy and infectious diseases, terrorism, and drug and human trafficking.\"\n\n\"There are also concerns related to many security threats such as escalating geopolitical competition, unresolved territorial disputes, the accelerating arms race, and uncontrolled spread of weapons technology,\" he said.\n\n\"Although there has been no direct military confrontation (between major powers), there is a risk of eventual conflict. In particular, many areas of confrontation have arisen that we may have not assessed correctly,\" he said.\n\nGen Seiha led a Cambodian delegation, comprising Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF) General Vong Pisen, General Nem Sowath, Director-General of the General Department of Policy and Foreign Affairs of the Ministry of National Defence, Lieutenant General Hun Manith, the head of the Ministry of National Defence's military intelligence unit, and deputy commander of the Royal Cambodian Army (RCA) and Lieutenant General Prak Sovanna, RCA Deputy Commander to participate in the defence summit.\n\nGen Seiha said building security cooperation is important for peace and stakeholders should strive to promote multilateral mechanisms through regional cooperation with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) at the core in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nStakeholders should use ASEAN strengths to attract countries to the bloc and related meetings to promote mutual trust and confidence, as well as regional solidarity and cooperation, he said.\n\nAs a member of ASEAN, Cambodia would like to see ASEAN members continue to support and adhere to ASEAN's centrality and unity. A breakup of ASEAN would have a negative impact not only on the bloc's member states, but also on other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, he said.\n\nIn a sideline meeting, Gen Seiha spoke with Singapore Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen, with both sides committed to working together for peace in ASEAN, with bilateral cooperation between the countries strengthening over the years.\n\nAccording to a statement from the Defence Ministry yesterday, Gen Seiha thanked the Singapore's Defence Minister for providing an opportunity for the Cambodian Defence Ministry delegation to participate in the defence summit.\n\nCooperation between Cambodia and Singapore has moved forward strongly over the years, and Gen Seiha expects bilateral ties to continue to grow with the aim of jointly maintaining regional peace.\n\nThe IISS first convened the Shangri-La Dialogue, also known as the Asian Regional Security Summit, in 2002.\n\nIt is Asia's premier defence summit, bringing together defence ministers and senior officials, as well as business leaders and security experts from across the Asia-Pacific, Europe, North America and beyond, to discuss the region's pressing security challenges.\n\nThis year's summit will be the 21st edition, as it did not take place in 2020 or 2021 owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

        "title": "Learning from OFAC sanctions violations",
        "body": "A RECENT Deloitte report analyzing sanction violation settlements issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), a branch of the US Department of the Treasury, presents a sobering picture for companies based in the Philippines, especially considering the magnitude of the potential financial penalties. Just within the period of the analysis (between January 2022 and April 2024), 34 settlements with the OFAC amounted to over $1.6 billion in financial penalties. This figure only scratches the surface, as it does not encompass the additional costs of organizational disruption or reputational damage.\n\nImpact on Philippine businesses\n\nDespite being geographically distant from the US, Philippine companies are not immune to the need to comply with sanction requirements. Given the OFAC's global reach, companies in the Philippines shoulder a legal and regulatory obligation to implement robust controls to ensure compliance. This means they must have mechanisms in place to ensure they avoid any transactions with individuals, companies, or countries that appear on the OFAC's various sanctions lists. This includes buying or selling products, providing or receiving services, and transferring or receiving funds to or from sanctioned parties.\n\nIt's a complex situation, and remaining compliant is no small feat -- particularly given the current global geopolitical environment where requirements change rapidly, with new sanctions often being imposed with immediate effect. Compounding these challenges is the criminal intent of those seeking to evade sanctions, routinely deploying deceptive tactics to conceal their identities and masking the true beneficiary or purpose of their transactions.\n\nRegional tensions and geopolitical events can often trigger a cascade of new sanctions -- a scenario that we've seen recently because of the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine. Closer to home, the rising tension in the Taiwan Strait and the ongoing territorial dispute in the South China Sea involving China and several other claimant countries, including the Philippines, adds another layer of sanction risk, which could have significant ramifications for Philippine companies. As the US continues to demonstrate its support for its allies like the Philippines and Taiwan, the extension of US sanctions against Chinese interests is a real possibility in the event the dispute escalates further.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nFor the Philippines, any such extension could have important implications.\n\nThe economic interplay\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe economic relationship and supply chain between China and the Philippines are deeply intertwined, spanning various sectors such as manufacturing, infrastructure, real estate, energy, and technology. Philippine companies rely heavily on Chinese suppliers for raw materials, critical components, and intermediate goods essential for their operations. Conversely, Chinese companies view the Philippines as a strategic partner, sourcing resources and finished products to fuel their own economy.\n\nChina's investment in the Philippines has also been substantial, with significant capital flowing into sectors including infrastructure, manufacturing, real estate, energy and technology.\n\nThe challenges\n\nThe potential imposition of more US sanctions on Chinese interests is likely to be a concern for any business operating in the Philippines. Sanctions can often be imposed with immediate effect, leaving businesses no time to respond effectively, resulting in significant difficulties when seeking to remain compliant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis creates a number of potential issues:\n\n- Significant supply chain disruption. Given the deep integration of Chinese suppliers in the supply chains of many Philippine industries, sanctions could lead to sudden disruptions. Companies may find themselves unable to procure critical components or materials, jeopardizing production and operations.\n\n- Financial repercussions. In the event of non-compliance, access could be restricted to financing from US institutions or any entity that adheres to US sanctions regulations. This could lead to liquidity issues, increased borrowing costs and challenges in maintaining financial stability.\n\n- Legal and compliance risks. As the Deloitte report shows, non-compliance with OFAC sanctions requirements can result in severe penalties, including hefty fines and loss of access to the US financial system. This necessitates stringent compliance measures to avoid inadvertent violations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSensible steps that can be taken now:\n\n- Perform a comprehensive preemptive sanction risk assessment. First and foremost, companies in the Philippines should assess sanction risk now so that they can respond more effectively in the event that US sanctions against Chinese interests are extended in the future. Preparing in advance can prevent companies from being caught off guard. This could mean assessing what industries and goods are most likely to be impacted and identifying alternative suppliers. It would also be prudent to anticipate potential import/export restrictions, which is another tool being increasingly utilized by US authorities.\n\n- Prioritize and tailor your compliance program. Our analysis found that in 88 percent of cases, when determining the financial penalty, the OFAC considered a robust compliance program tailored to the organization's size and complexity a significant mitigating factor. A comprehensive compliance program can help manage the risk of sanctions violations and, in the event of a breach, could be taken into consideration when determining any settlement.\n\n- Provide comprehensive and regular training. Compliance training programs should not be seen as a one-time event but as an ongoing process that evolves alongside regulatory changes, emerging risks and organizational requirements. Regular training sessions, tailored to employees' roles, can help foster a culture of accountability and awareness, reducing the likelihood of sanctions violations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConclusion\n\nIn a world where we have seen geopolitical tensions result in new sanctions being rapidly introduced, staying ahead of the curve is not just a strategic advantage -- it's a necessity.\n\nHopefully, the dispute in the South China Sea won't deteriorate further. But if it does, and US sanctions against Chinese interests are extended, it could create a complex puzzle for companies in the Philippines to solve, and hence, it would be prudent to consider this scenario in advance.\n\nAs the old adage goes, \"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\" Thinking about the risks now, rather than waiting for potential sanctions to be imposed, can help companies in the Philippines manage their risk more effectively and increase the chance of remaining compliant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo access Deloitte Philippines' report, \"Paying the price: Why violating OFAC sanctions can be a costly lesson for global businesses,\" please visit this link: https://www2.deloitte.com/ph/en/pages/financial-advisory/articles/ofac-sanctions-costly-lesson.html.\n\nThe author is the managing director of Deloitte Forensic at Deloitte Philippines, a member of the Deloitte Asia Pacific Network.

        "body": "While the Marcos Jr. administration has been unrelenting in efforts to tap foreign investments through official and working visits to several countries since assuming office in mid-2022, it appears from a broader perspective, the Philippines is lagging behind other countries in the region in attracting precious investments shifting away from China.\n\nThat's according to the Japanese investment bank Nomura, which recently described the Philippines as falling behind the flock of Asia's \"new flying geese.\"\n\nThe investment bank pointed out the shift in supply chains away from China has set in motion what Japanese economist Kaname Akamatsu called the \"wild-geese-flying pattern\" of economic growth, whereby production shifts from the lead goose (advanced nation) to the next flock of geese (developing nations).\n\nNomura noted the Philippines and Indonesia do not appear to be the first choice for global companies looking for new production bases elsewhere, despite being among the fastest growing economies in the region with favorable demographics and strong reform prospects.\n\nAmong the new flock of Asian geese, Nomura said, Vietnam and Thailand are the clear winners based on the results of a survey of around 130 companies.\n\nThe two front-runners are expected to continue to build on these gains, despite Thailand facing a structural deterioration in competitiveness.\n\nThe bank cited at least two factors for the failure of the Philippines to corner a bigger chunk of foreign investments: barriers to entry in the local manufacturing sector and our geopolitical tensions with Beijing,\n\nThe Philippines has been unable to benefit significantly from supply chain relocations in the electronics sector despite the commodity accounting for nearly 60 percent of its total exports.\n\nThis reflects serious issues in the manufacturing sector, which is still small and even declining in its share of total output.\n\nPower rates that remain the highest in the region and poor connectivity after decades of underspending in infrastructure keep transport and logistics costs high.\n\nTo make matters worse, Nomura said, our maritime dispute with China is hampering the inflows of Chinese investments: \"Recent geopolitical concerns from the dispute in the South China Sea could be an impediment to Chinese companies looking to diversify supply chains into the Philippines.\"\n\nBut there's good news amid all this.
